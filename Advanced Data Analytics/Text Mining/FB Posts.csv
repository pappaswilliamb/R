Won't be buying GMO corn at Walmart...or any other products known to be GMO grown or laced.
"Your website is acting up! it wont let me look up items says ""your request cannot be processed"" -_-"
Made appt. for 4 for the mortgage help.  Arrived at 3:35.   Still waiting to get back!  So much for your reputation.
"Kelloggs.com doesn't allow e-mail contact so I'll try this. I bought 2 boxes of the new Flatbread Breakfast Sandwich. Don't waste your money.  They have ""o"" taste and had to throw out 7 of the 8 sandwiches. $10 lost. They are horrible.  Diane Gunther  di909@aol.com  11-01-12"
"Trying to order online.  Have cleared all cookies & cache.  Have tried multiple browsers.  My shopping bag is saved but I ALWAYS get an error message when I click on ""Shopping Bag.""  UGH!"
"Thank for wasting almost 2 hours of my life.  Your AA.com website has missing pages and when I try to find the page that your website tells me ""AA.com makes it easy to access your future and past itinerary and receipt"" - that page DOES NOT EXIST!  This one: https://www.aa.com/i18n/urls/receipt.jsp  For the love of sweet Jesus help me find it!!!!"
they should change it from Delta airlines to Delayed airlines
so mad that the purchase is not going through. I had the items in my card by 11:02 am and clicked purchase by 11:05 am... and kept bringing an error message and now the site is not even working... phone is busy
I have been on hold for 15 mins and counting waiting
32 minutes on hold and still havent spoken to a human
The ticket agent at ewr this am was very mean. She doesn't like her job and should work somewhere else
"My luggage had a free trip to Detroit today, too bad I was in St. Louis. Thanks for the inconvenience Delta. :-("
3.5 hours and still at LaGuardia are you kidding now a 20 min weather hold and the cabin heats up with no air.   DELTA. FAIL!!!!!!
Trying to spend money with your company but your website is down. Hope it's back up soon. Might have to divert to delta.com
bad bank   bad bank   bad bank.  Shame on Bank of America.  You treat your clients badly. We will neveer forget how you have behaved.
your call center is closed? it's 9:32a EST and i haven't been able to talk to a SINGLE PERSON. i've been calling for 15 minutes. #stepitup
"Me: ""Why can't I view my credit card statements past 2 years?"" Wells Fargo: ""Because that's the way it is."" Me: ""Can you transfer me to someone who can explain why."" Wells Fargo: ""Yes"" (transferred FOUR TIMES). Wells Fargo final answer: ""......................................"" Their final department had no human on the other end."
All I can say is do not fly AA. They lose your luggage. Don't apologize and don't make it up to you. 12 hours and counting without my luggage....
Can not believe your still in business! I HAD to use your airline cause it was the only airline i guess that could take us to Punta Cana. BUT it had to be connecting flights. The service on the plane was horrible. Hot in the cabin. Rude staff. No snacks or drinks! This is why I only travel Jetblue. I didnt think AA was like this. But i will ONLY fly Jetblue for now on. And it was a tight squeeze!! Are your customers cattle? Just load them on the plane!! I paid alot of money for crap!!! Your planes are OLD. No tvs to watch. I have to watch whatever you want. What a mess your airline is. Like i said i had to connect. But i will connect somewhere else for now on. AA is a joke. Jetblue is LUXURY!!!
"U.S. Bank ---  The biggest bunch of incompetent loan officers I have EVER seen in all my years of real estate !!!  BEWARE FOLKS...  If you want a deal to go smooth, do NOT use them as your lender!  They lie and lie and lie...  Can't get loans done in the time frame THEY say...  Avoid them like the plague !!!!"
"More fake issues with the plane. There is only one flight to Reno today from ORD. If I miss it, I will miss a very special celebration. Pilots are jerks"
NEVER AGAIN.  10 hour flight and not even a video screen in the back of the seat.  Unbelievable.   Why would you even use such an old plane for such a long journey?
Y'all are a joke! I have spent over 4 hours on the phone and in one of your branches trying fix yalls mistakes!
The CVS website is giving me a major headache right now.
"Have a rant here...but when you call to stop one bank card and they cancel the wrong one...you go to use it, of course with everyone standing around...you find out they cancelled the wrong card.  oops they say on their end.  You suck, B of A and you need to update your site on your banks in what states.  Zero in most now...very incomptent personnel.  Thanks for nothing.  Oh yeah this happened during a move across the states so hows that for being stranded with no card, and no banks in the state we are in.   Got gas?  Oh yeah no card to use in machine...so NO! For you cancelled the wrong card you idiots."
"so my friend is stuck in Phila. airport. She was bumped off a flight she had reserved months ago. How can you do this? If she doesn't get out of there and home today she will lose her job. DO YOU CARE??? NO!!! People that booked 2 days ago & paid a $30 upgrade charge got on the flight. You took my friend's money when she booked her flight  & gave her NO SERVICE. If you can't get her on one of your planes, get her on another airline's planes...and don't charge her $600...what i am hearing is absolutely ridiculous."
I am upset with your airline today.  How could you possibly take less care of frequent flyers like Kourtney Govro.   Getting on an AA flight now... might be my last purchase with you.
We were at Wal-mart today and picked up a bottle of your Strawberry Syrup - Sugar Free.  Must tell you my husband wasn't impressed.  Too thin and not a lot of flavor.  Needs more work!
"Doing my best to stay a loyal frequent flyer (Million Miler and Plat for 9 years) ... AA is doing all they can to drive me away.  My 73 year old mother has been in Sacramento since last night 8.30pm diverted on the way to Reno.  Okay, bad weather.... what the hell was the excuse since 7am this morning....????? It's now 3.55pm and she's still there!  WTF???? Even the pilot and crew couldn't figure out what the hell the last two hours delays were!!! AA get your damned act together or more like me will walk!"
"You have the worst customer service known to man.  1. I try to checkout online, it tells me half the stuff is unavailable at check out.  2. your free shipping doesnt come up free.  3. i have been on hold for 13 minutes with no answer.  FINAL RESULT I am NOT checking out and using kohls.  Your loss, I was going to spend 250 bucks that will now be spent at your competitor.  I will also never use you guys again."
O.K. now why are you using GMO frankenfood?  I am a plain jane Corn Flakes Eater and I now found out that you are using GMO corn.  Big mistake.  I am Boycotting Kelloggs Products.
Sitting on your broken airplane in Atlanta Without a/c. Worst airline ever. Should have flown frontier
"NEVER, NEVER, NEVER LOAN REFINANCE THROUGH WF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They keep Alabama time zone hours, so on the west coast I have to call at 5 a.m. And you don't have any one there after 3p.m. Thats stupid"
Can't find our pilots for flight UA865? You guys usually do such a great job. How does this happen?
My flight from OAK to SAN - delay for over 3 hours due to mechanical issue... not a happy camper! :-(
"Campbells is poison - chemicals, bpas in the lining...make soup people! Cook like our grannies did."
Help! I am in Paris on vacation and unable to get someone on the phone. BOFA put some kind of block on my card!!!!! At this point I have been on hold for 30 minutes! Huge phone bill!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Help!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm tired of going to walmart just to find out you are out of something. This has happened 3 out of the last 4 time I have been. the 150 store in Winston Salem. So today I go to the Walmart Express 45 min. after I was in line and only two people in front of me and the had only 4 items....
Best Buy is the worst store ever!! Its pretty annoying to have a problem every time I go in there!   And everyone is rude...closing my credit card and will prob never shop there again....
"Never again. First class and no music,movies or any entertaiment on a 5 hour flight. Not going back o US."
Holy cow. Boarding stopped because they can't find a flight attendant! We are supposed to be in the air in 15.....
"Some of the slowest tellers work at this bank. The line keeps getting longer and longer. It seems like they are in slow motion. I hate to complain, but shouldn't they be more efficient? I've been in line for 25 minutes!! Then you tell me there might be a fee for depositing money into an account??! Really? And the teller can't explain why! WOW!"
not happy with Kraft...sent email regarding a product issue days ago...no response.
"Can you find a worse branch than the the Bank of A at 730 W. Lancaster Blvd? Rude, slow, and always an excuse!"

I do not like going to PetSmart to the grooming area to take OLIVIA! Very RUDE! I wont be goibg back there
"Ummm...really united.  SFO -> EWR #825.  30 min early turns into 20 min late.  No ground crew at gate so thats 15 more min, now 40 min waiting for bags???  Epic fail."
Found the secret to getting a good seat. One person pays the $10 then saves the seats. There were at least a dozen people saving seats on the way to Anaheim.  Love Southwest but your boarding process sucks
Pretty sad when your Premier Execs are on hold for over 1/2 hour.
"So I LOVE cottage cheese and sent my husband to the store for some. He brought me back your new cottage cheese from Simply Kraft. Now I love Kraft products they are a staple in our household.. But your cottage cheese was the most awful thing ever. I ended up throwing it away because I disliked how it tasted so much. And it had not gone bad, that I am aware of."
"Hey Kroger, the links on the email you sent me DON'T WORK!"
"Upset. I planned all day yesterday to bring my rescue dog to you for nail trim. It was suggested I come late b/c other dogs not good. They said 8:30 best since close 9:00. I get there 8:30, grooming closed!! I just cried right there on the spot."
Worst airlines....lost luggage and won't take ownership for losing it! Pay up!!!
Thanks for ending my beautiful vacation with. A nightmare. Day in the airport. Flight 1012 is just. Boarding  from. 2:20 pm.  After. Sitting on plane For 2 hrs and waiting for a status update 3hrs later.  Very sad customer and no good service
"U.S. Bank since when do you cut off someones debit card and not tell them .. BTW it expires in 2015 .. and you tell me that I have to go into the local branch to see what they can do since you cant do anything at the customer call center .... uh you customer service, what can you do. All I was told is I can't do this here, I can't do that here ... customer service needs to be cut off.  I been a member since 1990 and I am ready to take my money (5 figures) somewhere else. U.S. Bank sucks!!!"
TOP 3 REASONS CVS BLOWS!  1. judging by the length of there receipts they obviously don't care about trees!   2. god forbid you have to go in after 8pm when there is the one lonely cashier who has the slightest since of urgency!!   3. when you post a complaint.. they refer you to a 800 number that has worst customer service then the store itself!!
"Anyone want a salad? Please Dole, hold the lady bugs next Time. No, that's not a cranberry in this salad bag its a dead lady bug"
"How's this for a great experience. Waited in line. When it was my turn, it took 15 minutes to ring me up. What's wrong with that. I only had 1 item. They overcharge me. Gave me the runaround. Store sucks."
ypur head phones sock had to buy 2 pairs at $6 dollars each.then u witched a pair lastest 1 day each time u need to take them off the shelf never buy head phones from your place again.they suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The preferred access program is terrible. The lines for first class check-in now have longer wait times than coach. What an insult to  your loyal, frequent flyers."
"Day 3 of being stranded in Scotland without my luggage. Thanks, Delta. Called customer service in the US to see if thet could help and they were useless."
Fuck you US AIRWAYS. I have a schedule to uphold. Maintain better standards for maintenance of your aircraft. (oh and thank you for the opportunity to take part in the wonder that is manned flight.)
Prescription is not ready yet. ... it was sent in 90 minutes ago!
"Ok, what is the problem?I know it's Christmas and everyone is in a hurry.I just pulled up to a drive thru out was 3 till five I know she saw me coming and closed the window!!!! It's bad enough they close too too early.Three are some of us who don't have 9 to 5 schedules.It's looking more and  more like this was a bad choice leaving my other bank...5 to close come on get real 6 is more reasonable more a days!!!!!"
Not to be mean but Kelloge krave is one the worst tasting cereals I have eaten. I swear I wish I had my receipt or something.
Just got some peaches and found a spider in a sealed peach cup
I will be closing my accounts with US Bank. You guys are the WORST bank i have ever dealt with and your dang Phone Bankers want to argue all the dang time. I can not wait to close them.
Once again a spoiled bowl of Oatmeal because the Swiss Dairy milk went bad 8 days before the Best Use by Date of Apr. 22nd.  This has happened continually...need to find a new milk vendor as I will NEVER by milk again from CVS.
I purchased $911.20 worth of lap top ; warranty and beat headphones for my granddaughter.  I couldn't find the code.  I called four days later and was kept on the phone for two hours.  The sales associates couldn't tell me where to find the code.  She told me to check the box the lalp top came in.  No one ever answered.  Best Buy doesn't have a site where you can file a complaint.  I may return everything.  I will never buy from them again!!!!
Today while shopping at Kroger.   Cashier: wow your pregnant  Me: yup  Cashier: when you due?  Me: they will be here in June  Cashier: June? You look like your about to pop!

Cashier: your are having twins to make up for all the babies that have died by abortion  Me: uh no! I am having twins because they run in my family!    WTF ?! Seriously!
"Hey Kroger, your Wayne, Michigan store is full of a bunch of  fucking assholes. Twice now I've been treated like shit by them, so SUCK MY BALLS KROGER! dickheads."
"DO NOT buy fish from the Petsmart in Conyers, GA!!!! They have the fish disease. I purchased 2 not knowing about htis at the time, petsmart did not want to refund me. They told me I was lying about this and were very rude. I called corporate to tell them of the situation, what a big waste of time. All I want is my money back, a lousy $13.00 and they can't even do that!"
"My baby Oscar WIOLL NOT be groomed by PetSmart groomer's ever again. They clipped a portion of his right ear off, then put glue on it to stop the bleeding! To top it off, the groomer told me that he was moving too much which in turn caused her to clip him?! SMH"
"Again on the phone with your worldticket desk. Got promise after promise that my ticket would be reissued, paid again (!) a fee. Now on Sydney airport and still NOTHING is done and I can't fly. I have only one word for this: LIARS!!"
"Nordstrom I really love you and have since I was an infant... but today the shoes I ordered in-store to be delivered to my home arrived... used. When I called my local Nordstrom I was told to call the shipping Nordstrom because that would have ""more effect"". I say, a problem is brought to you, you handle it, not pass the buck. And what am I for my trouble? Out my shoes for another week. Bummer."
"hey walmart your shopping cart suck!! you make a ton of money and people need jobs...... they shake, they screech, their rusted,and half the time they dont have a seatbelt for my son... i mean come on you make too much money for your carts to look and function like this........ thx  hopefully i see a change soon"
"Everytime I get photos from your store, they are messed up! And no one wants to help fix the problem at the store! I will never order prints from you again."
"Went to Best Buy in South Center to buy a lap top with my brother. He is very ill and undergoing treatment. We talked to the salesman and picked out a model. He checked stock and said the only ones they had were reserved for the Black Friday sale. I explained that it would be very difficult for us to return on Friday. He said he would talk to the Mgr. When he returned he stated that they would be able to help us. We went through the check out bs and then they said it would ship in a few days, What Crap! We told them we wanted one today. WE even changed the model once to get it that day. They would not work with us and wasted a lot of our time. Best Buy YOU HAVE POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I will never step in your store again.  BEWARE OF BEST BUY"
"I can't STAND going into Walmart.  Every time I've ever been in one, there's 20 check-out lanes, and ONE teller, with 17  or so people in line, waiting to check out.  I don't care HOW MUCH  you save; it's not worth that hassle."
Why do we now have to wait 7 days for UA flights to post?  In the past they would post within 3 days and if not we could submit a request for those miles then?  This OLD CO SHARES SYSTEM is the pits!!!!  Cant we have UNITED BACK???
"My husbands flight to meet me and our girls on vacation was cancelled! Now he needs to miss 8 extra hours of work and still arrive at 11:30 pm tonight! We've waited on hold for hours and hours and have recieved NO HELP! If you are so short staffed, hire more pilots! Dont just cancel a flight we booked months ago! Very poor costumer service!"
"I had to call about 5 times, a total of about 1.5 hours on the phone and email several times just to get a response to my request.  What kind of service is this?"
so i bought a t.v. in november and it go's out . i return it and get an exchange-kool. then it go's out again. each time it go's out its less then 90 day. go back and they want me to pay the differance on another t.v. because they dont have that model anymore. on top of that most of the t.v.'s they have on display they dont have at all. so if they are not going to carry them anymore take them down. the manager that helped me was great but his hands seemed to be tide behind his back and wasn't able to help get a better t.v. . so i had to down size because they did have any t.v.'s in stock and i wasnt going to take a floor model. Target get it together!!! unhappy customer
"Why I don'y shop there  Shauna Van Riper  Ok so I go to CVS to buy some 40s n the troll @ the counter takes my id, gets a look of disgust, n turns to the other lady n asks ""what am I lookin at?!"" Then throws my id on the counter when I had my hand reached out! Damn! Dont hate! Hahaha"
"Now before i start i have never had a bad experience shopping at Gamestop. Now i orderd a used game call Dragon Quest 8 from your website, paid an extra 10 bucks to ship faster. when i got the game it was a demo disc.....even said not for resale. why would you sell a demo disc when its not the full game? i feel ripped off."
"Seriously, just delayed another half hour in Knoxville! This is the worst trip ever! You have ruined my daughters birthday. You caused me to miss her birthday and then I had to spend her birthday money on the crappy hotel you reserved me last night. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!"
"Can't say ""thanks"" for your IVR, it is the WORST!  By the time I reached a live person today, I was so frustrated I was mad ... and I didn't start out mad.  Really, I complain about your IVR to every agent I've talked to ... you'd think you'd start to listen!"
How do I get a hold of a real freaking person on the phone!!
"very rude people work for your airline,and will never fly with you again....."
Dear Khols over the last two months I have spent about fifty five dollars on shoes for my nine year old son.  The first pair feel apart.  I didn't think two much about it. So I went and bought him a new pair a different brand. He showed me today where the new ones were falling apart again. When telling a few of my friends they also told me about items of clothing and shoes they purchased that we're fall apart. I will no linger spend any money at your store.
"On hold with Best Buy right now. Current wait time: 3 hours, really, come on..."
y CAN'T I GET ON THE STORE SITE... IVE BEEN TRYING SINCE YESTERDAY MORNING!
Been delayed in Edmonton for 6 hours and still no update... Not happy and I will make sure to make all the social networks aware!!! No sleep for 24hrs...horrible!
"Worst flight of my life! Vegas to Pgh emergency medical stop, not allowed off the plane for close to 3 hours now. No food offered just water. Sore with swollen feet no place to move. Awful experience. Not worth the free bags."
"joan - 866-579-8583, is no help and rude. Ryan working there is the reason for the issue. Juive is a liar. the customer service call center is Horribly rude. Sam 972-537-2152 does not return calls. 3 weeks and i havent heard from you and cant get ONE operator!!!"
So I go buy 2 xbox 360 games & a controller today & spend $100. To get home & find out 1 of the games is not in the case. Wtf? Really. & not to mention they closed already so I can't get it today. I'm so mad.
"Trying to book airfare for a multi-city business trip.  What?  NO flights between Kansas City and Tulsa at all the day I need to fly out??  Can't even get through to the call line, either!  Just called the 800 # and it doesn't even pick up.  FRUSTRATING."
"@AmericanAir No excuse for this. First class flight non stop LGA to ORD 12/29/2012. Luggage lost,can't reach AA on the phone, tweets going nowhere, no offer of help or effort to find my luggage. Vacation ruined. Visiting my kids for New Years. Now no clot"
"My husband's plane was cancelled yesterday due to ""mechanical problems"", then weather. Today he was bumped. Boo to US Airways. We won't be using them again."
Your service is terrible!! My son is trying to fly home to MI from CT. He paid you lots of money to be home tonight. His flight had been delayed 4 times already. Really Delta???? How bad can you be?
You should see the bag of salad I opened tonight... had a date of tomorrow.. what rubbish it looked like.. I'll post it for you tomorrow.
"This really sucks, your website is down your call center is down. Awful !!!"
Sent email to customer support. Problem with bread. Purchased at Columbus Indiana. Has a distinct smell of pepper spray.  Is not strong oder. I now think it is from the plastic wrap and not the bread itself. But the bread gas absorbed the smell. Can smell it inside and outside the wrapping  Still have the bag/ loaf. Whats left of it.  Keeping for future reference.
My name is Arlene Bruno. I live in Florida. I wanted to tell you how Delta Airlines treated a Military family that was trying to fly home to see her grand mother who is in hospices in her last stage of breast cancer. It would completely amaze you how Delta treated them. Over the name on a ticket. My daughter and son n law are stationed in Califorina with the Navy. They have two small children. One is 1.5 the other is 3 mths. She wanted to come out to see my mother before she passed but could not buy the tickets. So I paid for half and she paid for half. We also decided that we could cut the cost if we drove to main airports. So I drove 2.5 hours to Orlando. She drove 3 hours to LAX. When she got there she wanted to be honest with Delta ( which turned out to be our mistake) and tell them that her husband was not able to get leave and that she would be traveling with the two children alone. That she would just use her husbands seat for her son who is 1.5. He would have been setting in his farther lap anyway. They told her that she could not do that becuase her sons name was not on the ticket.....but her son was listed for travel. So she asked if they could just transfer the ticket to her sons name. They said no. They told her.... that she would have to buy her son another ticket. Now we bought these two tickets for a little over 600.00. They wanted 900.00 to buy the same seat that we had already bought again for the same child to set in. It took a lot of talking but we finally decided ok...we will just charge it on a card and go. They cancelled my son n laws ticket .......then told us that all the seats had been sold. They could not give my grandson a ticket because they had over booked the flight with 5 people and as soon as she cx my son n laws ticket one of the other over booked people got his seat. So they could not get on the flight.  She asked if they could get on a later flight today. They told her it was booked but that her and her 2 kids could come back 3 hours before the flight ( which is a 11 tonight )and wait around to see if a seat become open. That would cost 700.00 more. So her and her family made the 3 hour trip home and I made 2.5 hour trip home. We are out of 600.00 and she will not be able to see her grandmother.
It's great that you will text people or call with updates on flights. But why are you incapable of doing it timely?!? If you know that an inbound flight took off late and the flight is 2.5 hours why can you not give my 2.5 hours notice instead of 1hr when I am already at the airport???? Why is this so difficult and why does it ALWAYS happen. Reason 48628629267 you re bankrupt!!!!!!
"By far...the worst airline, worst service, and horrible travel experience each and every time I have to fly on this airline.  Sometimes, I have no choice but to fly U.S. Air...but I would encourage you to avoid this airline at any and all costs!!"
I think it is the worst company in terms of service to its customers. have lost my luggage and my wife (pregnant) of our trip to the states for 16 days. made us stay two days at the airport in las vegas to find yourself on the luggage trolleys. Lost! Thank you Delta!
Over a week now and still no response from my message sent to facebook@bestbuy.com.
FIX your ONLINE BANKING......HOLY CRAP it's been down for HOURS..........FIRE your IT Director who does not have this system on a backup!  Amateurs.......
"Since my question cannot be answered online, I had to call the 800 number. I'm now at 55 minutes on hold waiting for customer service. Wow. Impressive."
Your customer reps used to be mug nicer before the merge!!!  Please make them nice again.
Today my curtain rod will be shipped! It has taken 21 days to deliver ONE CURTAIN ROD. And I haven't received one response from my complaints to customer service. Way to go Macy's!
"WORST service ever!! There is no one at ""customer service"" that will speak to you....NEVER flying with American again!! Nothing but a run around..."
"WOW!!! So I don't even get a canned response from you guys, just my post DELETED!!!!!"
"I am a premiere gold member and I have tried twice in the last 2 days to get an agent on the phone with no success.  I hung up both times after waiting 20 minutes. IS ANYONE ANSWERING THE PHONES?? HELLO!! Before the ""merger"" I never had a long wait on Continental.  Every time I fly I read all of the ""Good News"" from Jeff Smisek telling me how great things are going to be. Why don't you try answering the stupid phone? That would be a good start."
tolok 3 hours to my medicene today.not frist time this has happened.
I have spent more than 2hours on hold with United today!! NOT happy!
I'm going to cry. Seriously. Just got a double booking on my flight. I hope it stops at just 2 and I don't get the 40 booking I had last week. I don't know if I can trust this airline anymore. Why can't you resolve the multiple bookings issue? I've flown on SW hundreds of times but now I think I have to look for another airline. So sad.....
"Sorry southwest.  You sucked pretty hard today.  First you delayed my flight from 610 to 930.  Then your customer service person, who was very nice, switched me to a different flight.  Then that one was supposed to leave at 250.  Then 350.  Then you fixed the plane and switched us to a different plane that wasn't here yet and gave that plane to a Phoenix flight.  Now its 415 and I am still sitting here at a different gate.  Oh and another member of our party flying out of kansas city, yeah they are delayed too.  No weather.  Clear skies.  Sorry but you really blow today."
"I opened a brand new, sealed box of Frosted Mini Wheats this morning.  Expiration date March, 2013.  Poured a bowl of it, poured milk, took a few bites.. then noticed the black bugs in the milk.  I looked in the box...yup, bugs.. I""m revolted.  I freaked out in my kitchen so badly that my 4 year old is scared to eat cereal now.  I called Kellogg's customer service.  They offered me a coupon for two boxes of cereal.  I asked to speak to the Manager.  The rep said she'd have the manager call me as soon as she came out of her meeting.  That was 9 hours ago.  I guess this consumer is not all that important to Kellogg's!!"
"Worst game store ever!!!! I just bought 2 games that didnt work, you lost me as a customer!!!"
"For the life of me I have no idea how this organization stays in business.  I have been on the phone with these clowns for the better part of an hour to unscrew their mistake.  I'm on hold forever, the calls hangs up, and I spend 20 more minutes and get transferred to an outside company.  On hold again.......waiting............waiting..........NO ONE FRIGGIN LISTENS.  Jesus I hate this bank!"
I will not shop petsmart ever again. I bought two bags of blue buffalo and they were full of worms. the store would not do anything for me. AND After they opened a bag in front of me that was full of worms. to expencive to throw away. I'm out of here
"Been on hold 73 minutes and someone picked up the phone and hung up!!!    They bill my credit card $19,000 and hang up I am not a happy camper right now."
I will never shop at best buy again I recently ordered a wine cellar for my kitchen.it has been a nightmare after 1 and a half months 10 phone 2days off waiting they sent me the wrong product.then more time on the phone.with people that ask your personal info 6 times .they are the worst!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I picked up a couple games yesterday, and pre-ordered Hitman. I spent a couple hours playing the sniper challenge. then I opened up FIFA and to my surprise, there was no disk in the case."
What is up with the US reservation line? I have only gotten fast busy for over an hour.
"Our flights this weekend were overbooked, the planes were filthy, and we arrived late. To top it off, the baggage fees are ridiculous. Shame on you. We will choose to use other airlines in the future."
Hello? About a week ago my phone died and I was sad because I couldn't check my Instagram for dem new party pics. I asked to use an employee phone and he told me no. Not okay.
Bought a computer two and a half weeks ago. Had to have it shipped from a neighboring store. Came up twice after the one week mark and the best answer I get is.... uh idk  thanks best buy
"Just feel like complaining: wells Fargo should hire patient and nice phone reps who doesn't assume everyone speak perfect English! it's not my first language! And I kindly asked the rep to repeat, but she just raised her voice and got louder n louder . Basically she was yelling at me. I'm gonna change my bank soon."
"Just received my K-cup starbucks packs but something seemed fishy. When I opened it up, this is what I saw. Missing K-cup and someone had switched them around. That's too much integrity compromise for me to trust the product inside. Shame on whoever did it, and I'm sorry I won't be able to enjoy the samples."
"United!  You did it again! I figured that after a week after go live you would have some lessons learned!  1). At least I was on hold for ONLY one hour!  2). I was transferred to the Mileage Plus department but got a message saying that they closed as 10 pm PST and hung up - please note that it is only 9pm PST!  3) I emailed you guys about a week ago and still have not gotten a response, 4) True, you gave me miles for my 3 hour inconvenience last week but the only way to show you care is to stop wasting my time.  FYI - I never called back nor did I get my issue resolved.  You have one more strike and it it's off to Delta for me."
Boo American Airlines.  I am sitting in DFW at the listed departure gate B12...when i go up to see what the delay is they inform me that there was a gate change to B23 and did not announce it.  Missed the flight.  A simple heads-up announcement sure would have been nice!  You can do so much better than that!
worest customer service i every had.transfered my scrips there when walgreens didnt take my insurance anymore. been nothing but trouble . call in an order and they say an hour go to pick up 2 hours later and still not done. this has happend so many time i couldnt even start to count. taking my biz some  place else!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"To all my loved ones and people I care about...if you happen to be walking down the soup aisle and see this new Campbells Chunky Kickin Buffalo Chicken and you think to yourself ""man, that sounds good, Im gonna try it!"" Dont. Just keep on walking. Grab the Chicken and Dumplings soup and leave. I opened the can and smelled it and thought it tasted like hatred and Hitler. I thought maybe it just smells bad but tastes good, so I started heating it up and thought it would be smart to taste it before I wasted 10 hard-earned minutes of my life that I would never get back. If its even possible, it tasted worse than it smelled. I almost threw up and my eyes started watering. It just makes you wonder who is taste testing these products and thinks ""Yea thats good. It tastes like a Goodyear and my old gym sock...perfect"""
"My dr. computer sent prescriptions at approx. 10:30 a.m. today at 1:30 still not ready; when I called at 4 I was told that they were still in the system and I should give them a time to pick up.  I gave them until 5.  I'm heading there now.  I realize they are busy, but they also have enough incompetent people standing around.  Clerk a few weeks ago was looking up my LAST name using my FIRST name.  I told the pharmacist today to either fire a few people or just shut down.  Unbelievable."
"You guys stole my photo negatives, what the heck guys. </3"
I hope all of your staff aren't as rude as the ones currently on our Seattle to Detroit flight. Wow!
Why is it that Customer Service at BOA stinks ???? UUUUGGGGHHHH !!!
It would be nice if our loan office / servicer would return our phone calls.  I've called her 7 times since July 13th.
3rd delay on my flight today.  Labor slow Down AVOID United
"Please stop selling spoiled food... I tried contacting you about it by email, but still no response after a week"
How am I supposed to make a change if your 800 number has busy for 3 hours???
"Delta, when we purchased our ticket to New Orleans months ago (fully paid) there was a reason why we chose our flight at 9.45 from LGA. Then you cancelled the flight at 2am and rebooked us to a much later flight! When will you learn to respect people's choices!! and this comes from your so called ""valuable"" Platinum Elite member..."
I just found a rusty metal screw in a box of your Rice Krispies cereal. I included a photo for you to see for yourself so you can match it with one of your machines.  PLEASE warn people before a child gets hurt... I almost swallowed it and when I took it out of my mouth my fingers became black with rust... or what I HOPE was rust.
"I closed out 3 of my 6 accounts with you today. I'd like to let you know why. I have been with you almost 6 years. Never over drafted my account, always paid my credit card off, never late either. In those 6 years, you have done nothing for me. I ask to have my credit card looked into that we've had for 4 years about getting it unsecured and get the run around. The only branch near my home is full of VERY rude people. I plan on moving the rest of my accounts by the end of the month. It's very sad that someone who has left a decent amount of money with you guys over the years, this is the thanks customers get."
The delivery system is a suck!!! ... Lousy service!!!
"Flight 1567 from Dallas to Vancouver now delayed 3 hours. No apparent reason. Pilots trying to fight their fight. Not the place to do it, ruining your customer service guys. Your being paid to fly. Fly. Fight your battles without customers suffering. Missed half the reason I was flying up in the first place now. #Fail"
I'm tired of the sales pitch everytime I go to your're stores. I came to buy a game not be scammed..
this is the absolute worst bank that i have ever banked with. what kind of scam do you all have going?
"I did NOT LUV waiting 1 hr & 15 min for my luggage today coming in from SLC to LAS on flight 940!  I could rationalize maybe 30 minutes, but really 75 minutes??????  I know, I know, bags fly free.  I guess you get what you pay for."
"I, for one, do not like the new program ""just for you""....too time consuming to pick out the coupons....then you get there and you find you want something that you did not check.....come on Safeway you can do better...."
"Well, it's starting.  Best Buy is already cancelling confirmed orders.   It states that they can't verify my information.  Strangely, it's the same info as the last time I placed an online order.   Tried twice, same thing.  oh well.  There's lots of other stores to shop from."
"Best Buy sold me a LCD TV, Best Buy was more than aware of the reviews on this product. Hundreds of complaints by reviewers on their site. My screen went blank like others people have stated, in 34 days!"
"Just had 2 of the worst dealings with Target store in Allen Park MIch, i have ever had. We bought 3 of our kids IPOD touches for christmas. one of them will not charge. the wife tried to exchange it for a new one. only to be treated like she stole it. not have the receipt only the shipping slip with order number. so I called today with my payment info hoping to get futher. NOPE treated like shit lady was rude and I had also requeste a copy of the receipt she acting like she really didnt want to but than agreed to email it to me. a hour later i still do not have it. if Target wishes  to correct this and for me to update this post they can call me daily before 2pm 313-909-8664 NO RECORDINGS ! If not we will be doing our Xmas and other year long shopping else where from now on."
"Dear Best Buy,  I really don't like you right now.  For over a year, I've been trying to get into my Reward Zone account.  For some reason, when you updated the site, my login wouldn't work.  When I tried to re-register my account, I was told I was already registered.  When I tried to reset my password, I was told the system could not do it and I would have to call the 800 number.  After several calls to this number every few months, it was one excuse after another.  Your system was down, please call back later.  I'm forwarding your request to a higher level, they will send you an email.  I've submitted changes, try to log in a few days later and it should work.  All of which were to no avail, no matter how many times I called and how many different answers I got.  Today, on a lark, I tried again to log in.  No dice.  So I tried to re-register my account.  Eureka!  It worked!  It allowed me to re-register, allowed me to enter a password and new phone number...I was in!  Well, not yet.  Back too the login screen.  OK, I get that.  Enter email and new password.  ""E07: We're sorry. Our system is experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again later.""  I did.  It didn't.  Again.  I really don't like you right now.  Sincerely,  Chuck (Formerly) Loyal Customer"
"I ordered an item from target.com, and got am email that shipping would be delayed. However, when I look that item up online, a if I was going to order it again, it says that it is in stock and ships within a few days. The listing should reflect the delay in shipping."
"Your TOP PAWS tie outs for dogs are horrible.  I bought one for my 1 yr. Boxer female pup and she shook it lose (somehow?) from her collar the third time I put it on her.  Your store was gracious enough to refund me for it.  But the guy there told me that yo no longer carry the tie outs made by BOSS PET PRODUCTS.  He looked them up and told me they were in Maple Heights, OH.  I called them to find out who sold them in the South Bend-Mishawaka, IN area.  They told me where and I went and bought the same tie-out (Heavy duty, 250lb dog) at a hardware store.  I notice that your reviews on your corporation website for your TOP PAWS tie-outs are terrible.  Why are you selling them? I had purchased the one made by BOSS from Petsmart years ago for my 97lb  Rott-Shepherd, Drake, and it lasted for 5 years until I had to let him go.  READ THE REVIEWS ON YOUR PRODUCTS!!!  By the way, the phone number to BOSS is 1-800-445-6347."
"I wish to complain about the horrible customer service I recieved at Gamestop online. I pre-ordered Diablo III CE 8 months ago. Very excited about it. Well when they went to process my order my credit card wasn't up to date so they sent me a e-mail. I updated my credit card on my account but that wasn't good enough I had to do it on the invoice, so I  tried their ""Update Credit Card"" feature on the invoice. It said error. I sent them a e-mail. no reply. I tried calling. Put on hold forever and gave up went to bed. I sent them another e-mail. They replied ""Order Cancelled"" My jaw dropped. I called them and waited........finally someone answers. They tell me tough luck. game is gone. My call was only an hour after I recieved the e-mail and they would not do anything about it. Then they erase my comments on this site and send me a e-mail asking me if I want to go on the waiting list."
"Whatever you do DO NOT go to the Best Buy in Carmel Mt. , CA if you want a pink 32G ipod 5th gen. You can't get 1 there for at least 6 days even though there are 30 at the Mission Valley store. They won't get it for you. You would have to use your time and gas. Or wait for them to order and send it to you. I was told even if I order online for in store pick up I wouldn't be able to get it there.  Guess I will take my money and make all my purchases elsewhere. So much for being a loyal customer."
"Mileage Plus agent took more miles from my account for an upgrade - no matter how many times I confirmed the amount.  Didn't realize it until I got back from my trip and could log into my account.  Called customer service - ""Your approximate wait time is 3 minutes.""  22 minutes later on hold and I hung up.  The CEO's video on the flight is bunk - anyone can talk the talk.  Continental doesn't walk the walk.  Guess I'm back on the phone tomorrow... again.  As if my time has no value!"
"We ordered a $40. birthday from the Coos Bay Safeway 2 weeks ago.  It is the only thing that my granddaughter wanted for her 3rd birthday.  Got a call today that the bakery did not have the ""kit"" to make the cake.  Really?  The order was placed 2 weeks ago.  And... get this... the cake decorator blamed the ""hispanic"" baker who took the order and that the wharehouse was out of the kits.  North Bend store was out of the kits too.  So, I called around to other Safeways and found a kit in Junction City.  So now Junction City is baking the cake...  Thank you Terra and Ashley for your kindness and professionalism in Junction City! I am sooo angry at Coos Bay and the fact that I have to drive the cake 2+ hours to Coos Bay."
How can I like a Bank that is so unresponsive to it's clients? Can someone PLEASE HELP ME WITH A SHORT SALE?????
I am so frustrated with your website. Your site is the only one that constantly freezes on me....which results in me having to close it and re-start it. I would shop Target over WalMart any day but their site is so much better.
I have a 16 year old flying solo on a delayed flight who may miss his next flight AND had to check his carry on bag. I've been on hold with US Airways for more than 30 minutes... is anybody there?
"Honestly CVS?  Darned if you do- darned if you don't!  When I send my coupons to the card 4872711591230 my local store's machine is broken, and when I try to print it out at home I can see the coupon under ""details"" but nothing is printed w/barcodes.  Almost makes one want to go to Walgreens!"
OH YEAH some supervisor named Dawn.....what a JERK!!!!!!
you guys delete posts too? about your customer service...
Tried to contact you through your site but it wanted ALL my personal info. RIDICULOUS! Just wanted to let you know how HORRIBLE your original Kraft Mac. & Cheese is AGAIN. Not cheesey anymore...just smells like plastic & tastes horrible! So much so that we took one bite and almost threw it up! This product was bad about 8 yrs. ago or so but I gave it another chance a few yrs. ago and it seemed to have gotten better again but now it's DISGUSTING! What a waste of our hard earned money not to mention our marg. & our milk. Very disappointed...AGAIN. :(
"My mother has been trying to get info and the status of her foreclosure for MONTHS. No one returns her calls. She's recieved NO statements. And now, I received, not her, ME, a notice of the scheduled sherriff's sale.  I am so tired of banks and wrongful foreclosures... my great grandparents had it right, bury your money in a coffee can, cause you can't trust a bank."
"Love Southwest and fly with you all the time, but have to slam the Las Vegas gate agents, that handled flight #160 heading to St. Louis!  The flight will now be 45 min to an hour late, because they can't count.  Spent WAY too long trying to figure out why they didn't have 1 seat left!  Normally, you're operations run very smooth and it's very much appreciated.  Just not today!"
Been using the Wells Fargo banking app for about 6 months now. Go to log on this morn & get a message that I need to update the app. Go to do that & the only way to update is to allow the new app to turn on my camera for taking pics and recording video anytime it wants. Really???!!! R u kidding me? What kind of BS is that? HELL NO!!!!
"I think in losing my brain cells traveling with you guys! Flew ewr to sfo, flight was an hr n half delayed with generators and cooling systems not functioning. We sat in hear for two hours never offered us any water! Late arrival in sfo, missed connection to Burbank. Last flight to Burbank canceled. Waited 3.5 hours for a reroute to LAX. Get to LAX, my luggage is still in sfo! Even tho I made sure to have the rep transfer the bag over. With 3.5 hours on hand, how did it not get there? Already past midnight in LA. Was told bag would be on first flight to BUR in the morning so it could be delivered to me. Im leaving for a cruise at noon!!! I call at 5:30am to ensure it'll happen, and an told no suh request was ever put in!! What the hell is going on with you people?!!!!! I was told that a request would be put in but no guarantee and the only way ill know is 20 min before take off at which point I could be told it never happened! So please tell me what the hell I should do now? Go buy new set of everything? This is beyond, way way way beyond unacceptable. This is ""I'm going to sue for my sanity"" status now. How is there no one to contact who can actually ensure things will get done! I have had it with united!! Flown you guys 12 times in 6 weeks, problem every single time!!"
"WTF. I buy tickets 4 MONTHS in advance so I can pick my seat so my friend and I can sit together and Delta changes her seat??! We call and there ""is nothing you can do?"" I bought it from your own website! Horrible customer service!"
"You asked me to provide the details of my experience. I did. When are you going to respond to me? Guess I'm not surprised with the level of experience on your Facebook page, falls in line with the service I received over the phone. How sad."
Ive been trying to call your Monroe la store for several days now...and no one will answer the phone...Ive let it ring for 20 min and still no answer.I need to know if the have a replacement bulb for a sony tv and before I drive an hour I need to know if they have it in stock...can you help???
"I'm not really happy with Safeway today.  My husband gave me a break and did the food shopping today for Mother's Day.  Apparently, the check out clerk had done the bulk of the bagging as my husband was bagging the rest.  When he got home, we noticed a portion of the food for my Mother's Day dinner never made it home. It was probably in a bag the check out clerk was doing. My husband refused to go back.  Moving forward, I'm just going to bag the stuff myself.  Missing food items even though we paid for them go MIA.  This was the Dublin, CA store on Dublin Blvd."
"WARNING: Do not give Best Buy your email address! The only way to Un-subscribe is via telephone! I am on the phone now - even as I write this -  and have been on-hold for a while now. EVIL Practice! Keep it up, BB, and I'll start buying elsewhere!"
"So I was just about to make some brown rice from your kroger brand and guess what?? I found 3 little worms in only 1/2 cup!!!!! And it was a brand new bag that I just opened, Im just disgusted!!! Funny how theyre just the same color but I saw they were all moving because of the heat...."
any mini wheat class action suits yet? getting anyone from kelllogs on the phone is at best a joke and at worst impossible.
I am extremly irritated with your customer service!  Called because I did not receive my rewards from a purchase I made in July.  In Aug I was told oops we forgot to credit your account. Called again today because I still have not received my rewards only to be told I have to wait until next month!  Nice system...needless to say your max rewards are for the birds!!!
"On flight 1035.  The plane is old,  attendants are tried and a bit cranky, the bathroom lock doesn't work and it smells like fish."
"I just posted this on my status:  Trying to get a hold of the Best Buy Geek Squad in  (Riverdale, UT). Apparently they don't know how to switch their phone off of the fax line, nor does anyone else know how to transfer calls without losing me. Not impressed at all. Oh and did I say my laptop contracted a virus within a week? I am not sure what happened to the free 6 month security system.  hmm...  What did I miss here?  Major Fail Best Buy!!!!   And I am still waiting for a ""Sales Associate"" after 8 minutes."
I cannot believe Best Buy still selling Zynga cards that don't work shame of you guys!!!
"Worst bank! had an account that I closed in 2010, they never closed now 2 years later I start receiving statements and letters stating I owe them money. I called closed it over the phone 9-4-12 and I still am receiving statements and letters. VERY ANNOYED! do not bank with BANK OF AMERICA"
Now you won't add me to the standby list on a flight that has open seats.
VERY upset with Southwest right now. They lost my luggage. I know we are only human and make mistakes but it took two whole days to get reunited with my luggage and I had to wear dirty clothes for 3 days. Unacceptable. Not a good way to start off my vacation.
I banked at suntrust for convenience. But today they refused to cash my payroll check because they was not familiar with the check. Well I been working at the same company for 12 years. The check is the same. I had to drive 1.5 hours to my credit union to get my check cashed. Sorry suntrust you just lost another customer. I'm surprised we still have banks because of the great friendly service credit unions give!
Just contacted Campbell's via email.  Today I poured chicken Alphabet soup out of the can and found two small fly looking bugs!!!!!  YIKES.. Worries me slightly as my four year old lives off of this soup at the moment which I am happy to give her because she does not like any type of meat except the chicken in the soup! know not so sure!!!
"Your stores are insane!!! Your Starbucks barista was chit chatting away with her friends about a new job and wasting time and made it hard for me to get my drink! Your cashier was flat out rude to me since I had 16 items in a 15 item lane... deal with it. The lines were easily ten deep. No wonder why your sister company went out of business!! Oh, and you'll probably never respond to this. Oh well."
"So unhappy with Target and Target.com I purchased a XBOX 360 bundle with2 remotes, one remote wont work and the local target wont exchange it because they dont carry the bundle, Target.com expects me to pay to ship the ENTIRE bundle back, so my children would have to be without their Christmas preswent for who knows how long. So much for guest services!  I will no longer give Target my business! Walmart would exchange this without question. Looks like I will be going back to being a Walmart shopper!"
"United + continental = Fail!!!!!! My flight was at 6:58 Am from Ord to Lga, i did check in online got my boarding pass on my phone. Arrived Airport @ 5:50 & my electric boarding pass was gone. Try on easy check in my flight move to Monday & return OrD on same day ^^' 3 agents 2hrs standing up to get new flight.. You send me to AA 9:40Am flight & AA throw me to 11:50 flight!! I should be Happy , its better than Monday flight right????  Hope u guys would do something!!! Btw AA have a big table for free coffee & juice .. Anything that United do or offer for this MESS???????????"
"How to request a price match online? Tried to use your chat feature, but they asked me to call (and it was an online order!). Im not in the US and spending 15 minutes of international call for that might not worth it. Just letting you know that Amazon does everything online - actually they never ask me to call. Where do you think Ill buy my gifts next season? When will you learn the lesson?"
"Stay away from target!  I will NEVER shop there again!  Bought 2 netbook computers for kids in early November.  Asked what return policy was just in case they hinted at something else instead.  Was told by electronics employee 90 days.  Great I said, enough time to return if I need to.  Well, kids really wanted Kindle Fire, so I got those and tried to return computers.  They said I only had 45 days and it is too late.  This was before Christmas!  I tried my best.  These are unopened.  Still have the seal on them from the factory.  I paid $197 for them.  They are now selling for $329.  They will make money on these if they would just take them back from me.  They won't.  No exceptions is their policy.  Well, my policy is NO TARGET.  And my family all fee the same way.  Never again will any of us step foot in target."
"Dear Bank of America: While I was in your bank again, I dealt with a different employee this time. I really don't appreciate having her wave her arms above her head, panicked looking and starting to sweat because she's trying to get the attention of her manager who was across the lobby as if I had just demanded money or something. NOT COOL. She couldn't even concentrate on what I was doing or sayi...ng to her. As another manager approached, she said...""UMMMM Ms. McKay isn't an account holder here soooooooooo maybe you can talk to her! OOOOOH ok!!! Hiiiiiiii Ms. McKay!! What can we do to get your business?!"" Me: NOTHING. But why??? I was a customer, never again. Well what can we do to get you back? NOTHING. What happened? Oh several things but the big one was depositing my money into a stranger's account not once but three times. I kind of don't like that. Oh. Yeah. Well, maybe we can get you back. What would it take? NOTHING. Then, I said have a great weekend, thank you : )  I can't even tell you the pure hell I went through as a customer with BOA. Never ever again and then they treated me horribly when I was a customer.So, really no thanks! What would it take? A million dollars. Will that work? And you don't even have to be nice to me. The fact that you have an employee waving her arms, yelling across the lobby and totally freaking out tells me you are DESPERATE. No thank you. Ugh, I got alive."
I want to know why the banks change the locks on a property knowing it is listed and then never contact the agent nor the seller if the home is vacant and then take over 6 weeks to get keys that by the way dont fit. then put another order in which takes 10 days to be told another 6 days someone will contact us. We have a contract that is in. File was closed because a BPO could not be done. And why ? because there are no keys. This file has been started and restarted 5 times. can someone help.
This is one of the worst banks around. I hope we never have to deal with them ever again. People wake up there are much better banks out there that are not out there for those high rates and will work with you and will not ruin your credit rating. If you do not want to go to a bank go to a credit union.
Best Buy sold me a 55 inch Toisheba flat screen last May. Completly stopped working last week. I did buy a 4yr warrenty also for $ 200.00. We cannot get the parts shipped out for some reason for another 2 weeks! Then we wait for the repairman to come. This should not have happened with a 1000.00 TV. No family entertainment is a hard pill to swallow . Why not a sub. from the store untill ours is fixed?
"Hello!  I am on your Flight 248 right now, going from Pittsburgh to Orlando.  I decided to spend the five bucks for wifi access for the trip--and you know what?  After waiting over five minutes for it to load a page (this one), I have concluded that your wifi service is horrible, not worth five cents ( let's forget dollars, okay?), and I will not waste my money on it ever again.    Other than that, the flight is fine.  Bye."
"My local Walgreens employees have been fairly awful to me, and to a friend of mine who works there. But that was nothing compared to finding out that they also support Susan G. Komen. I've just lost my taste for Walgreens, and there's a CVS down the street anyway."
What's up with the shopping bags?  The handle broke before I left the store and broke my picture frame as it crashed to the floor of the store. The store replaced :)  It looks like they are designed at the handles to separate like that.  Bad design in my opinion.
"You shouldn't be allowed to use the name ""food"" in the products you ""pass off"" as ""food"". More like franken-food, isn't that right, ConAgra? :D"
wonder what the record is for holding to wait for someone. Going on 1 hour and 20 min. Wouldn't be acceptable since i work in customer service.
Flight 1125 had been sitting at the gate for three hours; they won't let us off the plane. No flight attendants are in sight!!!! Awful customer service!!!!
"Let's see....my shopping experience today at Safeway Store #1270 in Daniel Stuart Square Shopping Center. I went into the store....nothing on the shelves, dirty floors, only 2 cashiers and the store was packed!!! I find this amazing and unacceptable since   I've sent in a complaint about this store before! The lines were at least 10 customers deep and not a soul that worked there seemed to care. After standing in a non moving line for 20 minutes...I walked out. I will never shop in this store again!!  Does Safeway Management even care about their customers??? From the looks of  it...it doesn't seem like that do!!!"
"I'm soooooo disappointed!!!! Your chicken noodle soup used to be amazing. I'm sick and I just ate some and this is what ended up happening... I fed the chicken to my dog cuz it was 75% fat, I ate the noodles even tho they were soggy and mushy, I poured the juice in the sunk cuz it was too greasy. And to top it off, there was no flavor! It tasted like water and grease!"
"Not loving the new merger this week. The website looks bad, why not stick with United's old layout which was really nice. Instead Continental IT wins out with a  non-user friendly site. Also, what is this $77.50 ""booking fee"" when using miles... not digging that either."
Your customer service SUCKS big time.  Why does it take 9 people and 8 weeks to resolve a debit card issue that was created by your office staff ?    REALLY ?
Your Services suck!!!!!! You started your day and end your day at 6 PM and charge stupid fees. :(  I let everyone I know not use your dissturb Services.
"Why is it the Texarkana Tx Store................... Do Not have the Boost Mobile ""Samsung Galaxy Prevail"" in Stock????????????? I call to  order it & they want ME to pay for it on the Phone?????????? It should have been in Stock already!!!!!!!!!!!!! called twice in 2 weeks????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Strange way to do business to me..........then it""s gonna take 8 days for it to come from the warehouse........Hmmmmmmmmmmm...............Really???????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
60mins wait time...as a Million Miler using the special number. Embarassing you guys can't get your act together for your top tier.
"The warehouse staff is extremely rude. If I was her boss, she would not have a job. But, the 'in store' staff is very pleasant to deal with."
"I love how none of the features work for auto loan account holders-can't pay online, can't chat with a rep, and can't use the email function. What convenience! :/"
"I am sad... I just learned that EVEN Citi has mobile check deposit :( I love you ally, but I'm sad right now because of you."
33 mins and finally spoke to someone. BOA sucks
"Stuck in miami. Still didn't take off in a plane that should have left at 5:45, now delayed for half more hour, while in the runway!!!"
"You might as well label your tights as disposable, because they get one wear TOPS before they rip. CSV: you're making me super cranky today."
Please HELP! Getting terrible service from home motgage refi team. Looking for help in escalating to someone who gives a hoot.
"you all are a bunch of idiots.  flight attendants, gate agents and peru much everyone else.  thanks for ruining my day"
SHAME ON YOU AMERICAN AIRLINES ... I will never fly your airline ever again... the way you treat people is just deplorable
my flight to chicago was cancelled today and the earliest that you can get me there is 3.5 days from now? really?! is that some kind of sick joke? It'd be nice if it seemed like you were trying to do something helpful for people that paid quite a bit to travel with you for the holidays!
I have been waiting for someone to pick up the phone for 41minutes 11 seconds to talk to a customer service rep to ask a question about my credit card. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
You have the WORST customer service on earth. There is no way to get through to a REAL person. No wonder I took my money and put it elsewhere.
your automated phone directory is of no help...all i want is my new milage number since you changed it going on 1.5 hrs on waiting to talk to someone
I'm very up set with the service I've received. I've been a long time faithful customer. And not sure if I'll be going back after this weekend. I was in to one of your stores last night. Asked for a couple games said they had online. The guy who I have always had a problem with and never friendly. Lied and told me no we don't have those games didn't even look. I go home place them on hold using in store pick up and now you magically had them. The guy is a liar and so are 95 percent of your employees. I'm sick being treated badly as a customer cause your employees show no respect except to there friends. I have been lied to like this many times but all these employees are still working there and been there for years now! I just thought I'd express how bad your company is. And how I've been treated
"This is the worst bank I have ever dealt with. Had problems with our mortgage and trying to make payments only to get some rude obnoxious bucket of excuses. Either put on hold forever or bounced to FIVE different people only to repeat the same story over and over. Went through loan modification that took over six months, three years ago. Luckily a call to the VA had it taken care of within a day. This bank posts ""We're here to serve you.  Customer service is our first priority. As a U.S. Bank mortgage customer, you can access your account online, see current rates and learn more about the mortgage products we have to offer."" on there website - THAT MAKES ME SICK! WHAT A CROCK! We are trying to stay current and make payments and getting nothing but grief while doing it!!"
"I just had the worst transaction at cvs ! I bought my newspapers, for the coupons of course , and I got home and found no coupons ! So, I called the store and the lady of course thinks I'm lying. So I take the papers back to speak to a manager. Go to the front counter, and the lady throws new papers at me , grabs the ones out of my hands and says"" these have coupons!"". I will never go back to that cvs. What happen to customer services??"
the people who work at store 731-8965 are without a doubt the most rude people I have ever dealt with.  And on top of that they are slower than a snail going uphill!  I will be taking my business to Walgreens from now on.
"I went to Walmart on Torrence Avenue in Lansing IL. I got bad customer service AGAIN! NO EXPRESS LANE OPENED, I Gave up waiting in line, and went somewhere else!"
"I had forgotten what a disaster your baggage services in PHL are.  How is it such a black hole?  I was PHL-DFW, checked in 1.5 hours early, and my bag is still in PHL.  I'm in my hotel in TX.  I travel for work and the percentage of times I have problem with USAir in PHL far exceeds any other airline/airport."
Had such an awful experience at L.A./USC branch today. WORST customer service that I have ever experiences at a bank! Time to fire BofA!
"I had my Dr. call in a prescription to the CVS store in Yuba City, CA at 10AM. I went in at 6PM to pick it up. It wasn't ready. The lady next to in line called her refill in the night before and it wasn't ready. How long should one expect to wait for a prescription. Evidently more than eight hours. No apology or anything. The clerk asked me if I wanted to wait. I think I'll find a different pharmacy."
Is it even possible for SWA to get me to my destination on time when flying through MDW? This is the second time in two months that I've been delayed. #FAIL
"Bought a pound of ground beef today with a sell by date of November 3rd, opened it up to make dinner & the smell almost made me vomit. Yes, it was SPOILED. Disgusting."
"Hello Bank of America, I've called three times to get the hold on my credit card lifted after it was put on a hold when I tried to buy something online. As much as I appreciate the high measures taken against fraud, the first time I called they said it was fixed when it wasn't. The second time I called, I was hung up on being transferred to the right person. The third time I called I was hung up on...after waiting for nearly 15 minutes. WTF?!"
"Tried some Coconut Curry soup tonight. Two bites and I threw it in the garbage. Should have known it was bad when it was heating in the microwave it smelled like air freshener. In other words artificial. It was totally nasty. Also the inconsistency of the size of the vegetables was very strange from itty bitty pieces of carrots to big giant pieces. Little chicken bits and large water chestnuts do not make for a good soup. I have had other coconut curry soup but I have never had any like that. I grew up in Philly across the river from Camden. My uncle, a farmer, grew tomatoes for Campbell soup in south Jersey. Back then the soup was tasty. Now not so much. So sad."
"Dear best buy, I hate you :) I pre ordered a game to find out the location I chose isn't doing a midnight release. So ack off."
You might want to train the agent at gate A22 at DFW (at noon today) in the fine art of customer service.  Time to switch to Delta.
"You guys suck, leaving a plane on the tarmac with passengers for five hours.  Just one of the reasons that I fly less and drive more."
We have been sitting on the Tarmac in Vegas for over 2 hours now. It's 105 degrees outside and about 90 degrees in this plane. We are getting very little updates on what is going on. Passengers are getting sick and we are not being offered anything to drink while we just sit here. As a very frequent biz flyer I am in utter shock by this and will never fly southwest again.
Not a happy customer. Still waiting for a response from customer service. Dont call today you get call centers.
"This is my posting on Yelp from my visit to CVS in Rockville on Key West on Friday night.   I called on Friday night as I was leaving work. At first they couldn't find the prescription my doctor called/sent in. After 10 minutes it was found. I explained that I have new insurance and the woman said, ""Not a problem, just bring it with you."" I asked if the prescription was ready yet and she said it would be about 10 minutes.  I arrived 20 minutes later and the prescription still wasn't ready. ""I meant 10 minutes from when I got your new insurance information."" Well she could have either A. mentioned that or B. taken it over the phone. I gave her the new information and she said the prescription would be ""Two-Fifty-Three."" I freaked and asked how five little generic pills could cost $253. She goes, ""Oh I meant it's two dollars and fifty three cents."" OK.  Fifteen minutes later my prescription is still not ready. However, a crowd has now gathered. I walked over to a tech and explained that I work in a medical facility and that one of my patients has just shown up. I explained that my privacy is critical and to please only use my first name when letting me know my prescription was ready. The tech stepped over and explained the situaiton to the tech who was calling out names.  Five minutes later that tech called me by just my first name (thankfully) but then the tech who went to ring me up used my last name. The tech I had spoken to leans over and goes, ""That was the one I said no last name!"" She replies, ""Oops!"" with a giant smile on her face.  I'm standing there very annoyed and put my other items on the counter. ""I don't think I said it THAT loud."" I didn't even have a response. She asks for my card and because I just wanted out I said I didn't have it. Usually at this point they use the store card but that would have taken effort. She rings me up and charges me full price for two items that were $10.49 each but buy one get one 50% off. I explain the sale and she begrudgingly uses the store card but it won't ring up so she manually enters a discount of $4.50 and asks for my card. ""$4.50 isn't 50% off of $10.49"" I informed her. She walks away to do the math and comes back to give the additional discount. Typically they'll round up, making my discount 75 cents but the tech did 74 cents. Not that big of a deal but it just added to my frustration.  As I walked away I approached a manger and explained this all to him. No apology, no offer to compensate me, nothing. He just nodded and said it would ""look into it."" Good to know CVS is doing so well. Guess they don't need my business."
So you wouldn't sell me (I am 31 years old) a bottle of wine because I happened to bring my sister to your store with me. I have been shopping at your stores 2 to 4 times a week for years. I will never spend another dollar at one of your stores again. Poor management and poor customer service.  Shame on you.
"You have been notified!! 6 messages to 3""points of contacts"" today as well as your so called ""customer realations"" who said they cared and I was done wrong with no call back! 40 months of lies and deception. I'm glad we have logged all our calls! Game on! Were going to court! Thanks for making my life hell for 3 plus years!"
US Bank Mobil banking deposit sucks! They are no help in correcting problems with their service. BEWARE DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE unless you want to chase your tail to solve problems !!!!!!!!!!!!!
"ok bank of america you delete my post . no worry , i have a solid proved that you guy lie to my mom and cheating the paper work about housing. you guy even ignore my lawyer call about the house status. no worry take you time i will go to the judge with lawyer and show the evidence . than i will call the news media. ohh btw between those time one of your people call my mom with his private phone and leaving the message . i still got that . it is sexual harassment."
WORST BANK EVER>>>BANK OF AMERICAN>...they are EVIL and SATAN RESIDES THERE>>>>>they will NOT take FAXES...they LIE and say YOUR NOT INSURED...even after EVERY PAPER has been faxed from the INSURANCE COMPANY....THEY put the WRONG address on my papers and it is NOT MINE at MY Home...so THE ADDRESS I AM MORTGAGED IS NOT MY OWN>>>THEY ARE IGNORANT PEOPLE>>>
"My mother is homeless now because of you....thanks so much for your care and concern. Someone should have noticed her home was in a divorce dispute before she purchased it 5yrs ago, but neither you nor her realtor did. Thank you for putting her and my brothers in the street right before the holidays in OKC, right before winter. Ya'll are the best....NOT! Your company screwed up and put my family out. This should be taken care of and she should be given back her home, free and clear for the screw up...but that won't happen. Atleast I can do something by voicing my opinion here and letting you know just how I feel about how the situation was handled...."
Hey aa....we are ready for what is next...... We didn't choose this current unreliability when we committed our loyalty to you....it is time to fix stuff....your relationships with your staff....your planes....etc.    You are hemorrhaging value right now.
"Well here we go again.  We have a flight to Paris in April, 2013 which I have previously posted our problems about.  We thought we had the problem solved.  So today my husband checked both the Delta side and Air France and Delta is showing the new seats 24GH and Air France side is showing the old seats 24 B & L which one of us on one side of the plane and the other on the opposite side of plane.  Someone at Air France didn't update the change to 24GH.  So now we had to start all over again and have someone at Delta sort the seats out on the Air France to and From Paris.  So you at Delta just code share but the customer has to do all the work when your ""partner"" drops the ball. !!!!  Believe me this is no way to run a business. !!!!!!!!!!"
Thanks soooo much for the $12 to buy half a lunch at Miami airport. This really made my day after you delayed the flight and could only offer a connection later tonight. I'm having a blast here at the airport with my almost free lunch. So much much better then spending time at the beach as I planed for today.   Btw - also grate choice moving these seats a little closer in your planes.   Looking forward to never ever fly with you again.
"Gotta tell you these days Im very upset at your Credit Card services. Two months ago we don't get a bill, so i call in to fully pay off card (which we do every month), I give my banking information and think its paid. The call taker entered wrong number..then i deal with hassle of that. Now the latest. You FINALLY offer direct withdrawl for the full amount on the card. We authorize this. BUT guess what, you have a programming error. It ignores the correct bank account number because its not with you & you take the money from an account that is with you (which then causes major problems because that was not the account the money was supposed to come out of)! My husband spent the last two hours trying to get this resolved! You can take money out of the incorrect checking account, but you cant send it back for two to three weeks!!!!!!Are you kidding me?! Is there anyone that has any common sense working for you? Im a very unhappy customer!"
"So dissatifyed with targets online shopping. Have tryed to get through to them by phone for the past 2 months, and always have a large volume of customers calling. Longest time on hold was over 45 min. So I emailed them 4 times!!!! And no return email!!!! So i went into my nearest store and they gave me the customer relations number, which i have been trying for the past 3 days, and have even left my my return number, But no return phone call. Last time I will be shopping with Target..."
Best Buy has a bunch of fucking idiots working for them...I would recommend anyone of my friend or anyone who seems this post to NEVER order from them.  They can't get their story straight if it depended on their life.  Every person we've talked to has no earthly clue what the person next to them is doing....Bunch of fucking imbeciles...DO NOT BUY FROM BEST BUY....
Thank you for losing my bags. And having customer service in Portland that doesn't give a sh*t about loyal customers. Now I need to buy a weeks worth of clothes and new suits.
Thanks for txt AA in response to my tweet.  Your sympathy doesn't fix the fact that understaffing will cause me to sit at DFW for more than 10 hours waiting on a flight I doubt will take off.  My 11:30 flight is now 8:50..  not a single seat open on any other flight.  My family could use my help dealing with the DC power outage.
American Airlines lost my luggage AGAIN!!! Your world tracer is a joke and your reps cant even tell me why it didnt go to my next connecting city. Flight from TPA-DFW-SFO-ICN...luggage made it to DFW but not SFO; as usual AA is clueless as to where it may be. I'll tell where it should have been...with me on the plane or sent forward to the final destination.
"Why I don't like to fly United. Had exit row seats booked for my flight with my best friend. Got a COMPLIMENTARY upgrade to First Class. Go to board the plane and I am ""not allowed to have that kind of an upgrade"". I am shoved to the back of the plane with apologies that it was a computer glitch and we will give you an aisle seat and the seat next to it will be open. Nope....I am squished next to some one. United will never be a first choice for me. I would rather pay more to fly any other carrier."
"What happened to OfficeMax. I loved buying from them, but their customer service has gone to waste. They cannot and refuse to recover from their own mistakes. Time to switch to Staples everyone."
I have never had poor service from SunTrust until today. An unbelievably rude rep who refused to help solve my problem. Worst customer service experience I have ever had...even topped Comcast which is hard to do.
"My Husband can't get home to Dallas from Santa Ana because you claim he never took his flight there. Um... HE'S IN CALIFORNIA, YOU charged him EXTRA to change his flight to get there. We have all the confirmations. Now you're making him purchase ANOTHER ticket to get home, but all the flights are full and the standby list is insanely long. Really AA? REALLY?!?! You all deserve coal where the sun don't shine."
"So just left the CVS in Salem, MA.  Walked up to pharmacist who was busy talking to a gentlemen, waited my turn to ask a question. The gentleman walks away & the pharmacist looks at me & says ""we're closed"". I say ""even to answer a quick question?"" She makes an annoyed sound & says ""what"". I say nevermind & start walking away and comment ""nice customer service skills"" & her response it to laugh. SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!!!! I would lose my job if I treated a guest that way. When I relay the story to the very nice girl at the checkout counter, her response is ""yeh, sorry, she has her moments."" Well isn't that dandy."
This is the first and I hope the last time I have to be on hold for 2 hours trying to find out about at prescription.  And this was with one call ahead of me.  Really??
"although I am very grateful for the good customer service, I am super disappointed in wait time.  I can't believe I was on hold for 55 minutes!!!! 38 for the first call and 17 once I got transferred."
"Bought some sandwich bags, got home and noticed the box had been taped shut. All the bags inside had holes in them. Looked like someone stuffed them back in the box and threw it back on the shelf. If 1 time use food storage boxes are open you shouldn't try to sell them to another customer."
"Placed an order on 11/24 for a holiday gift.  Had still not received it, so I checked order status and I see that you canceled the order (#6589973) with out ever notifying me.  Thanks a lot CVS.  Great customer service!"
"I am so mad at American Airlines.  When I got to Haiti I had 2 locks cut off of the same suit case.  There was shoes missing for the kids for school, among a few other things.  I wrote American Airlines and they said there was nothing they could do about it.  It is hard to raise support anyway and now we have to rebuy the shoes.  So don't think just because your suitcase is lockec (even with 2 locks) your stuff is safe, it is not.  American will do nothing about it."
"Traveling today with our Wells Fargo credit card. Tried to notify them this morning along with the card company of the other credit card we are carrying. Wells Fargo asked for so much info that we didn't have on us: exact$$ of our last purchase, our account number etc..our SSN, name adress etc wasn't enough. Other credit card company;..awesome customer service..worked with us.  Guess which card we are going to use when we travel?"
Is this a sick joke?  BofA has let too many houses rot due to neglect during their foreclosure processes.  Some houses BofA had no record of even owning.  Missouri AND Kansas.
I refinanced and no longer have to deal with Bank of America! I am a very happy man today! Worst and most ill knowledged customer service I've ever had! Wooo hooo!
Worst bank ever. Its been 1 year now since my loan modification started and is STILL going. I hope the 40 pages I just faxed you is sufficient. Apparently the last 100 wasn't enough!
Won't be dealing with Best Buy anymore!! I have been on hold for 50 minutes!! Customer service sucks!!
Thank you SOUTHWEST AIRLINES for completely destroying my luggage AND CLOTHES and then behaving as if i was the one who put it in a machine belt! Bags fly Free? They destroy them for free also. NEVER AGAIN SOUTHWEST.
"What is going on with AA??? My flight was delayed 2 hours yesterday. They leave the gate and then return 10 minutes later to the gate so it doesn't count as ""delayed."" Too bad the have a monopoly on the Caribbean."
I was highly disappointed in your won ton soup..it tasted noting like the original soup itself.. and tasted more like your chicken noodle soup..just under a different name :(
"Man this is getting confusing....OK, a Geek Squad Tech just called to confirm my appointment, again.  And. he just asked me what it was that he was going to do at my house.  After I explained what it was, he told me that the device I purchased would NOT work the way the salesperson told me it was going to WORK.  So, after a brief conversation, he said, ""Well you should just return it, since this not what you want.....So I said, OH NO not so fast!  I still get that FREE visit and I am going to stick with that appointment no matter what!  Then he said well then this is just gonna be a consultation. And, I said, we will figure that out when you get here.  Yes, I'm keeping that appointment!"
"Grrr.... I swore years ago I'd never fly Delta again after their track record w/ transporting pets but decided to give them another try. Well Delta, you have just reminded me of why I don't fly with you. You changed my flights & screwed us all up. We fly out Sat so yes, we're sticking to it but this time after this trip, when I say never shading I mean NEVER again! Ugh!"
UNFORTUNATELY MY ONLINE BANKING IS NOT FIXED! I NEED TECH SUPPORT & THEY SAY I HAVE TO WAIT 3 to 5 days - SO DO I CLOSE DOWN MY BUSINESS & WAIT?!!!! I need my bill pay & info on my profile!!!
Your Home Mortgage service organization is the worst I have ever experienced.  It would not be so bad if I could ever get someone on the phone or get them to return a phone a call!  :-(
"Hey target i know your sytems runs well but your employees are so disrespectful. Getting mad over certain things, I'm a target shopper but if i have to I'm going to switch to Wal-Mart. Thank you."
"Never, NEVER, buy a refurbished iPhone ...never order your ATT phone from Best Buy's order online to pick up in store. 2 hours later, after the sales person made numerous mistakes, and I've been double charged for my phone, and had to spend 2 more hrs on the phone with ATT tech support because it doesn't connect to WIFE, and now, I have to take it back because it has many issues. very frustrating!!! Oh..and Best Buy's 800 # put me on hold and never came back."
"Been 9 days since I could view transactions in 1 of my 4 accounts with you. First chat agent ""entered a ticket"" and promised me a call from ""that department"" within 2 business days...CALL NEVER CAME. Chatted again after 4 days. That agent copied all of my recent transactions into my chat window.  Why can your agents see my transactions, but I can't? That agent told me that I wouldn't be called until my issue was resolved. WHAT? How do I know anyone even cares if no one is calling to tell me that they're still working on it? Chatted again after 3 more days, demanding a supervisor. Chat agent said the supervisor would call within 1 - 2 business days. It's now 5pm PST on the 2nd business day...NO CALL.  Found out my issue is resolved...not because anyone called to tell me...but because I gave up on you exhibiting customer service skills and just checked on my own.  If you don't care about your customers, why should I care to stay with your bank?"
"Ok, I have used your app, and asked for help. Just like I thought no response. It says 1 business day. Once again a lie. Please fire Equator from doing your short sales. They do not know what they are doing. Now we are being told 120 days for final approval. It's funny how they keep raising the price over appraisal price. We should of had approval after first increase, no lost file. 2nd increase, no, now it doesn't meet Fannie Mae price guidelines. What is that?????? Bank gave price!!!!!!!!!!! Va appraisal is lower than bank price. Someone who knows what they are doing in this company please give me some answers. I will never reccomend your company. Your reputation with short sales is correct. You are the worst company to do business with."
"Nice.  Thanks... stuck on tarmac now nearly 2 hrs...  you rebook 1st class,  and I miss my connection flight.   So disappointed with service here @ Delta-RIC"
"Just want to let everyone know that I purchased a combo box from Sams club, that contained, Coco Crispies, Corn pops, and Apple Jack,. I took my 1st box back because when i opened the box the bags of cereal were opened, the 2nd box i just opened and found tons of human HAIR!! called Kelloggs,. and the lady told me to DIG out the strands of HAIR and send them in.. and they cant pull the cereal off the shelf because this is not serious, and the HAIR could have came from a machine!!! seriously??!!! This is your solution, this is beyond NASTY!! I will make sure that hundreds of people dont buy your NASTY containment cereal again!!  Better make sure you do something more appropriate next time!! Im not a push over, and I will post and post on this page!!!"
Went to Best Buy last night to purchase a tv and we were between two models that were the same price. Employee suggested we go with one model because it was newer....same brand. Today the other model was $400.00 cheaper and Best Buy won't budge on the one we bought. I will now do a return and buy the other tv at sears with the price match. The employee should have suggested the one that was going on sale since he knew our main concern was the sale price being lower the next day.
Please do not ever set foot in best buy. They have stolen 4 hours of my life and $200 they promised me. I went in to return a product that was NOT as described by the mobile team at bestbuy.com and they are refusing to refund me the credit I used to buy it. This is why companies like Best Buy suck the big one. O and I almost forgot to mention I have been on hold for a total of 2 hours with them this week.
I bought a cell phone thru you with the insurance plan. I wad sold one type n now told the salesman was wrong. My phone barely works n I'm very unhappy with it and the sales team service. How do we fix this?
"WARNING WARNING WARNING!  UNITED AIRLINES COULD CARELESS ABOUT LOSING YOUR BAGGAGE! AND WHEN YOU CALL TO FIND OUT WHERE YOUR BAGS ARE, THEY DIRECT YOUR CALL TO INDIA, WHERE THEY TELL YOU THERES NOTHING THEY CAN DO......"
"I bought a Zoo Med Reptisun 10.0 UVB 18 inch bulb - (PetsMart Item Number 2752589) from the other guy (Petco) because Petco price in the store was $29.99 compared to PetSmart price of $49.99. Unfortunately they only had one and I needed three. I stopped by my local PetSmart store in Plano Tx and asked them is they would price match Petco price of $29.99. The wonderful cashier said of course, as long as I had a receipt or an advertisement. I had my receipt! She needed a store manager to approve the transaction. The store manager - Naomi - snarled at the cashier that she would not accept the receipt, she must have an advertisement. I showed her the receipt I from Petco showing that I just paid $29.99 (plus tax) and she refused to price match. I found this very odd since I had my receipt from the same day, for the exact same item. I don't know what the difference is from an actual receipt and an advertisement.  Needless to say, I won't be shopping PetSmart very often anymore."
"Sadly, Target is no longer a place I'll shop.  If they make a mistake on your order online, they make you buy the stuff over again because they don't understand customer service.  Go to Walmart.  They always make it right and Amazon as well."
SAFEWAY IS EVIL...DO NOT BUY THEIR GMO HIGH FRUCTOSE CRAP!! THEIR ORGANIC IS A LIE!!
"I had a prescription submitted 8 days ago. They called me and said they had to check if my insurance covered it before they could fill it. I had to file a complaint with walgreens because no one followed up until I got a recorded message telling me to come in and get it. That was several days ago. I got a call today 1-20-2012 regarding this. The pharmacy called and put me on hold. I got tired of waiting and hung up. I got called back some time later and was told that they have to fill x number of orders per day. That's not my problem. I was told the electronic order system was faulty. Not my problem. I was told that while she is talking to me that 2 customers were having to wait. I told her fine, help them and hung up. I never got my medications, I was berated and she made out like it was all MY fault. Then she wanted to know if she should just mail it to me. I asked her if, after all this time she thought I still needed it. She didn't want to answer my question and eventually got the hint. The she went into a sales speech about how I should still be a customer. I said I'd had enough and hung up. I don't know if she's going to mail it without my asking her for it. If she does, how do I return a prescription??? Also, I don't want to get charged for it. I've never heard of such baloney from a pharmacy. That walgreen used to have a good pharmacist, now, I don't think I can trust them. I certainly don't want to be put on hold for a medication for over a week while they decide what they feel like doing. I know my doctor isn't happy with this either. What can I do at this point and how do I prevent this from happening to someone else? "
"Absolutely terrible company! I have never dealt with such unhelpful ""customer service"" and incompetence. TWICE they have lost my check for my car loan (has never happened before in my life!). They also stopped sending me my paper statements claiming I switched to online payments, which I never did. When I did try to pay online one time it was an utter disaster. They said they never received my payment because the account number was typed in wrong, which is a lie, because I typed in my account number and there was all of my information! When I called to fix it, the girl was a complete b*tch and said it was all my fault. Thank GOD I don't bank with them... I wouldn't EVER trust them with my money! I can't wait to pay this car off so I can say good riddance forever. Stay away if you can."
"Every time I go into the Port Richey, FL store the employees scatter like flies. I used to work at Best Buy. It is much different these days. If they don't get their act together they will end up like Circuit City...short circuited."
"it sucks that you dont really back up a tv purchased 12/26 when it dies less than 90 days later. Done buying large purchases there. Next time will buy from Anyone else.  SHip it out for 2-3 weeks? without a tv for 2-3 weeks> no thanks, my business goes elsewhere!!!!!"
"I'm done with you, United. I've been re-routed on 3 different flights today and I have yet to even leave my first airport. Not to mention no vouchers, no economy plus, nothing. So much for my loyalty. Those miles just went down the drain."
"Splain this:  Saturday morning, 10:30 a.m. in the burbs.  Five do-it-yourself check lanes open.  One live cashier at her register.  Hullo people!  Is this customer friendly?  Do I really want that treatment when Marsh is just as close?"
Just left best buy.  Never going back.  Just bought a otter box for my new iPhone 5 and ask for assistance not one of your employee wanted to help.  Store 552.  Why sell a product you can't help the customer when they ask assistance.
Wow!  Just stopped on the way from Dallas to Newark in St Louis. In all my years flying SWA I have never experienced such a negative and unpleasant flight crew. VERY disappointed!  This is not the SWA I am used to flying.
It has been ten days now and no one from wal mart cares enough to reply to the problem that I am having at the Leland store. I do believe monoply's have their advantages. Do you care walmart?
"I have always read that BofA has one of the worst customer service experiences, and today that became true. I was so rudely treated by 3 different people that clearly don't care about the customers. Yelled at for something it wasn't even my mistake, and kept being transferred to the same leveled people. Clearly a great reason to close my accounts.. couldn't be happier. Be careful they love to charge hidden fees, don't let them get you."
"Help!!!! I want my money back & some customer service. I'm severely disappointed with Cvs.com & its poor customer service.  I've been a huge fan and spender for years at your stores. I recently shopped Cvs.com for first time March 24. Bought two packs of diapers & assorted baby goods. Only received one item out of several. I called your customer service twice to get my order fulfilled & ea time they said it would ship. Nada. The third time I called, I said refund my mney because my kid no longer wears this size diaper & I was fed up. That was over a week ago & I still haven't received promised follow up.  Please resolve. I've wasted too much time already & feel like abandoning your retail too."
"I hate going to Gamestop to pick up a game that I pre-ordered, and find out that its gutted and on the shelf. Held for 48 hours my tail feather."
The folks in your New Jersey store made my 65-year-old sister cry yesterday when she went in to get help from the Geek Squad.  Shame on you Best Buy!
"Your Balance Rewards program is a HUGE disappointment.  I made a qualifying purchase 2 weeks ago and the points have STILL not been credited.  I've called 3 separate times, and the response from your customer service has been ""Give it a few more days and then call back"".  Today I called again, and their system crashed and wouldn't even let them sign in to my account.  The response?  ""Call back in 30 min to 1 hour"".  Nice, Walgreens.  Once you figure out your balance rewards program and points system, good luck winning back your customers."
"Went to the Williston, Vermont store for some headphones for my son. Tried to buy one of five deiiferent brands and guess what. Nothing in stock. I kept upping the price to pay and still nothing in inventory. I asked for some assistance and was told that the inventory is kept low right now. Boy, if it wasn't for a gift certificate I gave my son for Christmas I think we would have chosen somewhere else. Now I had to order them and pay shipping. What a bummer of a store!!!"
"Just came from your new store in Decatur Tx....(about 7pm)...I must say I WAS NOT IMPRESSED by your cashier and the manager on duty.  I asked the manager a question about a product not signed or priced well at all......When I asked my question about if an item was free if I bought the item displayed with it.  She rolled her eyes and said  ""Well what did the sign say?""  I told her it didnt say anything!!  Then the casier asked me if I had a ""care card"" I said "" No I have never been here before""  then she just rang it up with out asking me if I wanted a card.....Isnt it your card supposed to create customer loyalty by helping them save a few bucks every once in a while?  Again I was not impressed.  I have 13 yrs in the retail world 9 in management.......I know what customer service looks like.....this was not an example."
I'm not usually one to rant to a company but I had a quite irritating experience online 2 days ago. I saw a bunch of toddler clothing on a good sale and put about 8 items in my shopping bag. Once I started checkout one by one it told me these items were no longer available...sold out. Literally one by one! It took me about 20 minutes to checkout and I ended up with nothing left in my shopping bag! Why did this happen? It is very aggravating and wasted my time. And I really wanted those clothes for my daughter! Advise please...
I've been trying since early this morning to get on the website to book my flight. I'm not using the 35% off. Finally got on a few minutes ago only to see the prices have gone up!!!!!!  This is an odd since of loyalty to their customers.
"I bought 5 pairs of men's pants online a month ago and three of them are literally falling apart already. I've bought this same brand in the past with no issues and believe this is a manufacturing defect ... the bottom hem is separating on the lower edge ... the fabric itself is just like it's been cut! What is the best way to get these replaces ... at our local store or sending them back? Do I need to call customer service for a reference number or something if I send them back? I'd like them replaced, not a refund. Thanks!"
"""Need help? We're available 24/7 at 1-888-BEST BUY (1-888-237-8289)"" Went on your company website just now. Called the number posted. Guess I must not be in your 24/7 timezone."
I will never fly with American airlines again. Security was sent home at 10pm from Dallas airport one of the biggest airports in the US. Flight was scheduled at 12:45am showed up at 10:20 could not get through gate...they would not reschedule the flight! This is why they are going out of business!
"Once again, United has failed me.  After being issued a travel voucher when our flight was diverted in June, we used said voucher to travel in July.  Although we boarded the plane and it taxied to the runway, after sitting there for 2.5 hours, it returned to the gate and was cancelled.  United said we forfeited said voucher ""because we used it.""  Many emails and phone calls later we were supposedly re-issued a voucher to replace the ""used"" voucher, but never received it.  Turns out that's because it was never issued.  Naturally, Customer Care does not have a phone number.  So I guess more emails will ensue and if we're lucky they'll find a way to fix this by the end of the year.  Maybe."
"You all really need to stop selling used games... Had to go back 4 times to get a working halo 3, and now i have to go back tomorrow to return a christmas present that you guys gave me.. its broken.  seriously, wasting 60 bucks on broken games is bull"
It is a complete shame that Ally Bank does not live up to it's commercials.  I was very satisfied with them until I found out they have some of the same petty rules that all banks have.  They just disguise them better.  I am very dissappointed Ally.
wow... surprise.... It's been one week since I called about itunes gift cards that don't work (for my daughters birthday) and OMG i was supposed to hear from Best Buy media department (according to them 24-72 hours) about fixing them and surprise... No call from anyone.. THANK YOU BEST BUY what a shitful company!!!!
"Just a warning. At the Petsmart located in Houston, on Shepherd @w. alabama, I purchased a 2 pack of those little halloween themed dog bisquits.     I found a piece of metal in it. To be fair, I only found one, but please keep an eye out if you also purchase the halloween themed bisquits"
"AA- you have the worst service ever! Rude, disappearing insolent agents at STL. My luggage went on a plane without me. Forced to get basic necessities in St. Louis & lost wages due to the excessive delays & cancellations.   October 2 near Woodson Terrace, MO via mobile Just arrived from LAX...connecting flight to NY cancelled - stuck in St Louis for hours.& hours :((  Spent last night in a St. Louis hotel & now I'm back at the airport. Same scenario - earlier flight to NY cancelled, next one delayed....I'm losing patience :-( October 3 at 2:17pm via mobile"
I bought a bag of Hershey's mini chocolates and wondered out loud why they didn't taste as good as usual.  My daughter heard me and asked me if I knew they were bought out.  Go figure.....I guess the ingredients got changed to keep prices down.  Next time I will splurge on better chocolate.
your customer service line is absolute garbage. I just called in an incident at my local target and you attempt to resolve. NOTHING. thanks target!
"Best Buy...Your Aurora, CO warehouse and delivery team has treated me like dirt, lied to me and cost me 5 hours on my only day off. I spent $3500 of my hard earned cash on a top of the line LG washer and dryer to be delivered. I had to schedule it out 11 days due to my schedule. I was put last on the list. The dryer was installed but didn't work. The install team blamed the cord. They tried a new cord, same result. The install team said it was an internal issue with the dryer. They brought the machine back to the warehouse saying they would bring a NEW machine back Monday. The warehouse called and said the install team said to me that it was my house and there was nothing we could do since the new machine drew more power than my old one. After much debate the rep read me the required specs...identical to what my home has and what my old dryer requires. So after all of this I'm being delivered a defective piece on Monday. Bad form Best Buy. Screwing me out of 5 hours and $3500 is not cool. FYI I've disputed the charge with AMEX. If I do not have a new dryer or my old washer back in the same condition it left and your washer removed by Monday, 1/16/12 at 8 AM MST I will end up with a free washer...a $1750 value. While the gift would be appreciated it isn't worth the time I've had wasted on my end. Make this right. Even if made right I will not be making another Best Buy purchase. I plan to spend at least $10,000 on electronics, computers, software and appliances in '12, this being $3500 of that. I will be making this known to everybody I can...including the 5,565,241 people that ""like"" your page. Please contact me to let me know how you want to make this fair."
"Hi, please enroll some of your flight attendants in charm school. A mother with a small child very politely asked for a seat change to empty seats. This ""flight attendant"" barely looked at her, and just kept walking while said ""I don't care""...  so sad... Flight AA57 on 11/29 to Miami.  I have her name if anyone is interested."
"Walgreens rub me off the wrong way today!!! Submitted an order of photos online. They were supposed to be ready by 11:47pm according to Walgreens Photo Online order... I called to make sure they were ready and Laura at the Bowman location said "" We don't have then ready and there's nothing I can do for you"". Firsts I called to make sure there ready and they hang up on me twice....!!!!"
We just arrived in Vancouver on a WestJet flight from Chicago after catching an American flight from Detroit earlier this morning. Our bag never showed up and the agent could not tell us when or if it would arrive. We are here for my cousin's wedding and we now have no outfits to wear for any of the events. Thanks for that. Not planning to fly either airline ever again.
"you have horrible people working in your Washington, Mo pharmacy...very rude and also your so called discount plan is bait and switch policy..i paid twenty dollars to get in on it and then when it was time to renew my prescription took my med off the list!!!! wow ! very shady! i will never shop at walgreens again!!!"
"After 2 hours on the payphone with united because my flight was canceled, the service centre hung up on me at 5oclock because it was quitting time. I am now stuck in spain with no way home. To make matters worse the person on the phone actually asked me if I could find my own way home! You got me here I think it's only fair you get me home. I have now spent $200 dollars in phone service with no results"
"BEYOND frustrated with Best Buy! Usually I love them, but they have no idea where my shipment is! If I'd had it shipped to my house or work, Fed Ex or UPS would have had a tracking #. Ship it to the store and there is NO tracking, not even for the people at customer service! (Which I did only because I didn't want it sitting on my front porch all day, or left at my office on the weekend.) GRRR!"
"How come I cannot access the Kohl's Cares Dana Buchman merchandise on your website?  When I hit, shop now, it just takes me back to the Kohl's Cares page again."
It's like BoA goes out of their way to be awful... http://consumerist.com/2012/11/26/bank-of-america-is-really-good-at-losing-documents-really-bad-at-believing-my-mother-is-dead/
"You are the worst bank ever! I am closing my accounts with you after today's horrible service I've just experienced. . You talk down to customers. You lie to them. You make up fees. You give people the run around. You are a bank, you should safe guard money. Not steal it away from your ""customers."" This company doesn't seem to understand how to provide the ""5 star service"" or any service. This is a pathetic excuse for a company. And in this economy.... that' dangerous."
"Joey and I have a joint checking account through Bank of America because that's who his paychecks are written though from his work and there's a location right by my work so I can take care of our banking needs on my lunch, if need be. Went the other day to cash his check that he endorsed. They told me no, because they don't have his confirmation that he wants them to give me the cash... isn't that why we have ""joint"" checking?? So I tell them fine, just deposit it then and I'll go to the ATM and get it out. They tell me they wont even deposit it, I have to go to the ATM to deposit the check because I have a free checking account, which doesn't qualify for use of the tellers. Fine... I go to the ATM. It takes his check. Doesn't let me pull it out in cash. I drive back through the teller line, ask them wtf, they say it takes a full day to clear... I'm like, it's a BOA check! It's YOUR check, just transfer funds from one account to another, how hard is that?? So they say they have no option, so I have to wait. Thursday comes around, I go deposit my check into the ATM as requested. I wait my full day as requested. I go to use my card yesterday and now today, and it still doesn't work, my check hasn't cleared. I call them for them to tell me ""Oh, your paycheck threw up a red flag, we're putting a hold on your account. You can't have your money till it clears, you can't have your paycheck back, you're going to be screwed till we decide to let you have it."" and there's nothing I can do about it. Wouldn't even tell me what this ""red flag"" was about, if it's going to happen every paycheck or if it can be fixed. They just ""decide"" to do it and there's nothing you can do about it. Do not, EVER, under any circumstances, go with this bank. They have been nothing but horrible since day 1. Nothing but an inconvenience. Friends don't let friends do business with Bank of America. Spread the word."
"Such an awful experience today!  Every time I fly with US Airways my flight is delayed or cancelled. I had to resort to renting a car so that I could make it back to work and not lose 1000s of dollars.  And that was after waiting in long lines because they were grossly understaffed and watching the line at JetBlue efficiently move and receive prompt service. Get in the game, US Airways!!"
"I just want to tell you what happened to be at a Bank.of America on Silver Springs Blvd in Ocala, Fl. I went to the bank to get cash out. There was a long line at the atm so I used a drive through teller. Sent a check and my ID through and waited. The teller comes on the speaker and tells me that he gave my $315 & my ID to the wrong person and they are calling him now to see if he will come back. Shocked, I asked him what would happen if he doesnt. He tells me that they normally do. NORMALLY?!? Is this a common occurance?!? After waiting a while the man arrives with my money and my ID. But this is a mistake that should not happen. The drive through was not busy, maybe 2 or 3 cars there. There were 2 workers. Ive worked at a bank for several years so I get that it can be stressful, but this was blatent incompetency!! The guy who had my money had been gone several minutes before they realized it. I knew Id get my money but I needed my ID. Since its Saturday I would have had to wait till Monday and my job requires me to transport clients. I cant work without my license and would have had to miss 2 days of work. Everything worked out, but it very well may not have. Its the holidays and anyone could have taken that money and ran. I alerted the assistant manager who was very understanding and apologetic, but I thought you should know."
Your customer service is atrocious... Over an hour on the phone and no answers could be given... About to lose a customer... Great job!
Not sure how Dallas Love Field can delay a flight 6 hours when its the hub. Just get another plane. This is absurd. Really disappointed.
"WHY, WHY, WHY do you not have any inventory of anything I want to purchase? No wonder your profit is down. Come on! Your products are not even available for shipping. Amazon is kicking your butt hands down for inventory. Twice in the past two days I have searched your website to purchase items and have not been able to do so (no inventory). UGH!"
"Day after Thanksgiving shopping at Family Dollar in Albuquerque.  Couldn't find sale items.  Manager said ""Oh, we often have ads where we don't have sale items in store.  There was a table marked $1 items.  There was nothing on the table for $1.  Manager was so rude we will never go back to that store.  What experiences have others of you had?"
"Flew on Saturday night from Sao Paulo to Newark - left as CO 30 and landed as UA 30. And I have to say - worst cabin crew ever. Rude. Unhelpful. And completely disinterested in their jobs. I hope this is not the sign of things to come with the merger, because the crew on the way down (UA 861 on 25Feb) was fantastic. Looks to me like the difference between old UA crews and CO crews."
"INCREDIBLE, WE HAD TO CALL AMERICAN EXPRESS TO HELP US WITH OUR BAG CASE AND IF IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF THEM, THE BAG WOULD BE GIVEN FOR LOST AS A.A CLAIMED. BUUUUT EVEN THOUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS MADE A.A FIND THE BAG, A.A STILL NOT SEND THE BAG TO US, WHAT A MYSTERIOUS THING, NO? MAYBE THEY WANT TO STEAL OUR THINGS?   I AM VERY DISGUSTED WITH THIS SITUATION."
I have been trying to order cards from your site for over 2 hours and keep getting an error message. Guess I'll have to take my business across the street to CVS...discount ends tonight but your photo site isn't working and the chat with customer service isn't working either! Very frustrating!
"My baby has reflux and has to sleep upright in a bouncer.  We paid extra for a bouncer that folds for travel.  And you, United Airlines, didn't even bother to put it on the plane.  After a sleepless night with an uncomfortable baby, I don't think we'll be flying United again."
"I went to target on Monday and all the things were gone that were in a ad Sunday were gone. I was no given a rain check, coupon or anything else, so i shopped at Wallmart for my 10 grandchildren at Christmas. When Target sent me a e-mail about a upcoming sale, i wrote back. They never responded. I do not think they care one way or the other if i am there or not. I am not happy that they are so careless with a customer. I was lured in with promises from a ad only to have them say, "" too bad!"""
"Thank you for sending me a $50 ""rewards"" VISA card that doesn't work anywhere even online. I've sent you three, ""uno, dos, tres"" e-mails about your stinking card that doesn't work and I get no response. Then you charge the ""valued"" customer a dollar to call in for assistance. Your customer service is dreadful. What the H, E, double hockey sticks???"
"Way to go Best Buy! Good job on not knowing how the frick to handle a very important video game release! Good job on getting me to preorder Halo 4 at a store, not having a midnight release at that store, and not just transferring my order to a nearby store. Good job. Last time I EVER preorder at Best Buy. Is it any wonder your stocks are PLUMMETING?"
Hey SunTrust - been waiting a month for you to get your act together so I can get repairs done on my home. How about you show me some common courtesy and return a call or email? Our rep's voicemail box has been full for 2 weeks. Regular Customer Service cannot put me in contact with anyone else who can help. I pay my mortgage to you on time. Treat me with some respect. Your service is atrocious.
"DON'T BUY THE GNC CARD CARD AT RITE-AID! BOUGHT ONE WITH A $5 OFF DEAL AND THE CARD DOES NOT EVEN WORK, AND THEY ARE GIVING ME THE RUN-AROUND! I BOYCOT RITE-AID FOR THE POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY HAVE GIVEN ME THUS FAR!"
"I can not believe that when you post something about this bank that is not saying how wonderful they are, they take DOWN your POST. Kind of GUTLESS I would say. If it HURTS so much,CHANGE and have some CUSTOMER SERVICE."

"Major fail Delta.  My BRAND NEW suitcase got back to me minus 2 legs and 1 wheel.  The guy at the counter said ""sorry, protruding parts are not covered"".  Get home to find a thick glass bottle that was wrapped in several layers of bubble wrap/newspaper/clothes smashed and plastic toiletry bottles broke open.  What did you do, park a semi on it?  Not to mention that my suitcase wasn't even on MY plane and I had to wait another hour AFTER I landed to get what was left of my suitcase.  I paid $25 for this?"
"""Best Buy"" & ""Asus""  I just spent 2.5 hrs with ""Asus"" Product Support in the Country of ""Jamaica"" customer service.... I'm in Connecticut trying to get my wireless key board serviced????? It doesnt work properly, it has trouble recognizing the space bar...   I was told at Best buy to bring in my all in one unit and the key board would be sent out to manufacture repair. I need my computer... tried to reason and explained that I need my ""computer""!!!! I would use an other key board, I explained.  That, didnt work. I need help!!! May you make this as simple as a UPS pick up of the keyboard???? If it takes 3 weeks as Best buy and Jamaica Cust support explained it should NOT be a problem????? I just can't be without a computer for longer than three days..... What is truly your policy? Best Buy told me that "" if "" I would of purchased their warrantee I would of had a new keyboard already. I have a manufacture warrantee, I just purchased this all in one unit Jan 16, 2012. DO YOU STAND BY YOUR PRODUCT???? Please explain your repair policy to all ASUS users. I love my All in one computer but I don't like having to struggle with the keyboard or Best Buy and Asus customer service.'  Learned over the weekend that Best Buy in Stratford, CT no longer carries the Asus all in one.  :( "
"I WILL NEVER FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN. 4 OF US ARRIVED IN DALLAS FROM CANCUN AND 1 PERSON IN OUR PARTY GOT TO THE GATE 11 MINUTES BEFORE THE SCHEDULED DEPARTURE TIME AND THE DOOR WAS ALREADY CLOSED AND THEY REFUSED TO LET US ON, EVEN THO THE PLACE REMAINED AT THE GATE A GOOD 10 MINUTES WHILE WE STOOD THERE.

"SHAME on Delta for their treatment of the double amputee vet! If you think that some corporate oops statement suffices I have news for you...IT IS NOT ENOUGH! As a vet you have crapped on one of the most sacred individuals in this nation, you owe him much more than just a verbal excuse! You need to do much, much more!"
"Received an email on Friday that the Friday $5 specials would be honored all weekend. Went to my J4U account and clicked on them. Went to the Rt 40 Safeway, Catonsville MD at 8am on Sunday--was overcharged for Coke, Oil and Sugar. I had other items on the list that were J4U but didn't check them yet. I have no confidence in the system. They have no customer service until 10am (why???). While I have sent a detailed email to Customer Service, I have no confidence that there will be a response. I don't trust the system."
"I have a complaint...The last 3 bottles of Dr K I have purchased, (purchased at different times), have spewed all over the place when I opened them...I've had 3 different messes to have to clean up...I know that they moved the plant to another stated & are making it there now...Also the Cola sucks since it has been made somewhere else..Truthfully I used to prefer it over the name brands, not anymore...Not a happy customer right now!!!"
"I would like to tell you I have seldom been as shocked by bad customer experience as I was in the last 2 days.  A few months ago my family was bumped from a flight - we were given travel vouchers. Now what was supposed to compensate us for a nasty experience has turned into another nasty experience  Yesterday, I called the number on the voucher to use the travel voucher for a trip on July 4. I waited 40 minutes for an agent to pick up and then gave up.  Today, I called again. I waited 17 minutes, then I was told I can not use the voucher calling the number on the voucher. Why: the flight is in less than 10 days. I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was transferred waited 10 minutes then the phone went dead. I called again after 14 minutes I got a supervisor (Michelle Smith) asked why I couldn't use the voucher. She it was because the flight was in less than 10 days. She said I would need to go my nearest airport (45 minutes away) to get a ticket using the voucher. I said quite simply . You don't mention this anywhere on the voucher, so how could I now . You left my family stranded at an airport . Now I am trying to use a voucher you provided, and you are asking to travel 90 minutes plus parking at the airport to use the voucher.  For me this is not acceptable. I asked if I could pay by credit card and then send in the voucher to get the amount of the voucher credited back to my card. She said this wouldn't work. I asked why not and she hung up on me.  Your service could be a lot better "
"Bank of America... I DESPISE YOU!!! You all place a hold on MY money and won't release it till NEXT Saturday, the 29th! Shame on you!!!!!! Your customer service and your ""supervisors"" are just plain rude! I will be taking my business elsewhere after you decide to release MY funds! Shame on you!"
"Ok, can anyone in this company give me answers on the short sale I am working on? I am betting not. This company works on the premiss of pass the buck. Nobody and I do mean nobody knows what they are doing. Equator is a horrible company to be doing short sales. They can't hold on to a file longer than 3 min. after that it gets lost. If you the consumer has a mortgage with this company BEWARE they WILL NOT help you out. They lose files until they foreclose. You have been warned people."
"worst web site, can't pay my auto loan after trying mulitple times.  Just want to make a pymt to USBAnk it is impossible it seems.  USBank give me ten ways to use its bank, but how the hell do I pay your bank."
"This is starting to get really silly. I do not understand how almost every major brick and mortar bank has an app but a 100 % online bank does not. Ally is starting to seem as shady as BoA. You guys are 100 % online. Do you guys not see how silly and unprofessional your company looks? You started a thread on October 25th, 2011 on your own website and it is now 2012 and no word on when your app is going to be out. Kinda sad Ally Bank kinda sad. I am really disappointed."
"I am so very disappointed in Target. I ordered a couch. They sent me the wrong one. There are no true exchanges. I have to return the wrong one and then reorder the one I ordered originally.  I offered to keep the one I received and pay for the missing piece. They said that they could not just sell me the missing piece.  So now, I have to pay for a new one to be delivered, wait for a refund for the wrong one and hope they send me the right one. In the meantime, I have this monstrosity of a box with the wrong couch sitting in my small apartment and have to wait five days for them to pick it up.   So disappointed in Target."
Let me start by saying nearly every if not every piece of electronic equipment I own came from Best Buy. So when I complain there is a reason. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 16g in March. Last week the cord stopped working. After two trips to the Garner NC location and several phone calls to the Geek Squad I finally called Samsung on my own to get the cord replaced. What a disappointment this was. I can go to Walmart and pay less if I wanted this kind of service.
"Dear US Air: Flying out of Newark today.  I just had a lovely conversation with your ticket agent.  I asked why I had to pay 89 to sit in a seat that on my itinerary had been assigned to me. Yet when I went to checkin I had been reassigned to 22d which is the almost the last seat on the plane.  So to move back to the original seat area I now need to pay $89.(  Which two days ago you charged me 45.) nice bait  and switch scheme!  I asked how I could have  an assigned seat on my itinerary and yet go to check in and get put in the exact same seat at the back of the plane for outbound and return.  I asked the agent when the change happened and apparently it was yesterday BECAUSE it's summer!  You have lost me as a customer. Your agent told me that she couldn't help in a rude manner and then said to call you since "" she just works here"".   Better yet I have told my company  and hopefully the world that your airline SUCKs!   your not the cheapest when you charge 89 for a seat, (these are not prime seats they are everything from the exit row up to the first class cabin) and 25 dollars for a bag. Your adding 115 dollars each way to to the ticket price.  Sorry, but you have seen the last of this frequent flyer!   "
I thought you were a great airlines until today! My daughter an 2 yr old was unable to visit her family for Christmas because her daughter didnt have a boarding pass! She was so sad! My thing is how did she find out that she needed a ticket when she was in line to board the plane! Mind you she checked in an put her bags on the plane(which are in baltimore an shes still in Ma) with an agent! My grand baby was devistated and daughter was crying her eyes out! Now we have been on hold for 30min trying to locate her bags so her aunt can pick them up in Md! Thank you for ruining my holiday!
I would like to say thank you.  Thank you so much for ruining Christmas for a special little 6 year old girl.  We ordered her Santa gift and had it shipped to her house and paid just as much for shipping as we did for the actual item.  The item was suppose to be there today.  Shockingly now the arrival date has changed.  Your website says tomorrow and FedEx says by the 26th...neither work because as we all know Santa comes tonight.  I mean really...why say it can be there by one date and make customers pay that much for shipping if it won't arrive in time.  Now I've had to call my friend and let her know her daughter's gift will not be there tonight like it should be.  At the very least our shipping costs should be refunded to us.  I will never order from Walmart online again and you will be lucky if I ever step foot in a Walmart store again.  This is such horrible business practice especially at Christmas.
"Having a MONDAY!!!!!! Went to South Sioux Hy-Vee to get my rain check fulfilled for my caffiene free diet coke...wanted 8 only had 4 on the shelf and none in the back! Then the very expensive Xbox 360 has failed and Best Buy is being difficult about swapping it out with a console on the floor vs. a ""refurbished or repaired"" unit. Shelly bought this thing when it first came out and got the extended warranty from Best Buy expecting them to stand behind it........EPIC FAIL!!!!!!!"
"The chronic problems at SFO must be addressed.  Not only did I not get to SFO at all on Friday, but my return flight to DFW is once again delayed.  The real pisser is that my aircraft was given to another crew and I'm having to wait for an aircraft that wasn't even scheduled to land until an hour after I was supposed to be in the air.  Not only is the second aircraft late out of Dulles, but I get zero information out of the people here at SFO.  Either fix the problems in SFO or decrease the number of flights that are booked into this airport.    The excuses of weather are bogus.  The other two major airports here in the bay area, Oakland and San Jose have 15 min or less delays while SFO is at 3 hours.    Fix this mess.  That is the only answer that is acceptable."
"Not happy with you guys. I usually love you guys and rant and rave to all my friends, but you guys have definitely let the ball drop this time. I have now emailed you a SECOND time online, called in to you TWICE. No help, your customer service does not know how to transfer calls or help, so now I will be private messaging you. Hope someone will care, and actually help me out. Thank you."
"This can't be happening, another set back nightmare. Just heard from Don from Equator, he wants to push closing back again. Now till Jan 18, 2013. Says file won't be ready until then. If he hadn't of lost the file this wouldn't be happening. None of these set backs are because of seller or buyer. IT IS ALL EQUATOR'S FAULT. I don't understand why beacause of their negligence the other parties have to suffer. The sad thing is this company could care less. They got bailed out and don't care about anything else. I honestly think they are doing this on purpose just to foreclose on the seller. I guess hard work is something they don't know about. I would like someone to contact us and explain why Equator's stupidity should hurt the other parties."
"SunTrust has a new policy for Mortgage customers. If your mortgage is due on the first of the month and your payment does not arrive on the first of the month they call and leave a message by the 5th of the month. The message says, ""this is an attempt to collect a debt."" They don't charge for a late payment until the 16th. Customer service at SunTrust just told me the calls will eventually start on the first of the month. Now you can pay your bills on time and still getting collection phone calls. Chase is building a bank on (almost) every corner here in Atlanta...wonder what they are like?"
"So, I purchased several items online and PAID for them. They were supposed to be shipped to my home OR the local post office. Either way, they NEVER came. I went through proper channels and PetSmart assured me they would make a full refund. Still hasn't happened. I have contacted them several times to no avail. They did send me several emails claiming I would receive a return within 2-3 days. It's been a few weeks now. I finally (today) got a confirmation letter which says my return has been processed for a return of ZERO $$. Seems like PetSmart is either unethical or inept. I was hoping to continue doing business with them but after this, probably not gonna happen and will tell ALL my friends."
"Donia Hicks Just bought a Taco Bell Soft Shell Taco Kit on my recent grocery trip and the tortilla's are molded. The date for the exp on the box is June 15, 2012. The UPC is 028400067461 in case its a quality issue and not just my box. I will be contacting customer service. We had the entire meal ready and opened the soft shell taco's and found them covered in mold. Hope its a fluke and not a trend on the kits. We love these for quick week night meals."
"Come on American, please explain to me if this is policy or not... It happened again (check my post from a few months ago)... On flight 3844 ORD to ATL on a CRJ with a first class and then 2x2 in coach.. The 18th row seats A and B are both open.  I am in 9C with a bigger gentlemen next to me.  I try to move to 18 A NOPE flight attendant tells me she is sitting there and those seats can't be moved too.  I asked her why she doesn't use the jump seat so I don't have to sit buddy buddy with a guy and she tells me NOPE only if these seats are sold is she to use the jump seat...  Come on now I fly 100 regional segments a year... Do I really have to rub legs for a hour when a row is empty... Last time was a flight to MSP and then FB American said THAT WASN'T A POLICY.. so please help me understand how it happens again?  Thanks"
"~And after being on hold for a long time, they hang up on me...Seriously?  Your company lacks professionalism big time!!~"
"Why is it every time I try to go in and use Just For U it is broken?  Every time I get ""Bad Request: The request could not be understood by server due to malformed syntax."" I love the coupons but I can't use them if I can't add them to my account!"
"So you block me from doing online payments for my mortgage  that I make.....every month.....on time, just because I do not live in that house any longer.  I moved to be closer to my job, and that house is vacant and on the market for sale.  I pay every month to keep on the utilities to ensure everything is in working order and taken care of and have not missed a payment even though I am paying for another place to live.  It has been a burden for me to pay for for all housing bills for 2 places, but i am making it through. All i want to do is make my monthly payment, and how am i greeted?..... by being blocked from the convenience of making online payments.  Not only that, but i stay on the phone for nearly 30 minutes being put on hold to finally get to talk to someone, just to find out the only option I have for making my payment, is to do it over the phone for a $12 charge! $12!!!! Are you kidding me?  I realize the type of home loan i have states that i must make this home my primary residence, but in order for you guys to get paid, i had to move to take another job.  And now it seems you don't want me to pay you.  I thought the mortgage lenders are supposed to be helping people out???  The only thing I want is to make my payments without being swindled out of a bogus charge, but that seems to much to ask.  Shame on you US Bank. Happy Holidays!"
"Thanks AA for making up my mind about whether or not I will use you in the future. Delayed flights, missing connections, and on the return trip sitting and waiting for a gate while I see many open. I will choose another airline in the future."
I have never been treated or talked to so badly as ur gate agent did to me and my wife in kona hi. I guess you still don't care about the customer. This my platinum flight this year so I fly a little with you all.
The wifi on this plane is extremely slow.... Close to dial-up speed.... Yikes!
"I went to a US bank location today, Montbello branch in Denver.  I asked for two rolls of quarters.  I was told since I did not have a account, they could not help me.  What?????  This was mt first reaction too.  I had just finished reading a sticker on their window that said Money Magazine has voted them one of the best banks.    I called the branch and spoke with Dennis, Asst. Manager, he stated that he did not know why the teller refused to help me, but that they don't have to make change for anyone if they choose.  He was a little defensive at first and then apologized.  This was the worst first impression from a business I have had in a long time."
"Kohl's Make sure your warehouse packers pay attention to what they are shipping.  I was pleased to see online that my TEAL dutch oven was arriving today, after only a week.  To my great disappointment, the one they packed was YELLOW.  I am now on the phone, calling all the Kohl's in my area, and getting told they are out of the color I wanted.  This will not do at all, and it's not a great first impression with shopping with you! :("
"Discover - I have been a member for over a decade and pay off my card every month. I am 2 weeks late on my payment now because of relocating and not getting a bill while it went through the post office process. Now, I have a hold on my card and have been declined. I called and got terrible service. I will pay off the card today and never use it again.   Sincerely, former customer who has spent THOUSANDS of dollars with you."
"Just heard our news this morning telling us that BOA is going to impose ANOTHER fee for being a checking account customer...unless of course I have a mortgage with them or other bullcrap stipulations..(HEY THANKS FOR THE FEE, FOR BEING A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR SIX YEARS!) how about this, since you will gladly TAKE my money, and have no (understandable/English) answers as to why I'm charged fees on services I don't even utilize, and can't answer my questions without threating me with MORE account charges if it happens again, take your bank and shove it.  I'm looking for a credit union now.  You take and take and take, and then shake your fingers at us for not being able to afford YOUR FEES, when YOU turn around and ask for bail outs...I'm done.  Your customer service skills SUCK, your money management skills SUCK, and your ""thanks for being loyal"" to us gratitude S.U.C.K.S!  When are you going to put people on your board of director's staff that actually listen to, serve, and care about the people who keep you afloat?? "
"Since I can't call in since they are closed on the weekends... I'm making my compliant here.... this is the third time I'm complaining now about the CVS Pharmacy in Maricopa Arizona... NO ONE should have to wait 40 minutes in the drive thru lane at 9pm at night on a Thursday, find out a med is still not ready from weeks ago... come back on Friday 3 hours after the promised pick up time and find out again that its not ready... then go back today and wait 25 minutes in the drive thru.... only to hear from the temporary pharmacist flown in from California ""We have 500 scripts to still input and 400 to fill"" Call the 800 number and complain. How many times do I have to complain? I even had a 20 minute face to face conversation with the pharmacy DM Kari and the new Store owner Tammy. This is NOT acceptable. I have been going to this pharmacy since 2007. My daughter is on about 12 medications... my son 3... its not that easy to just ""switch"" You guys better get your acts together in Maricopa and QUICK. I'm tired of being told it will get better and go in there almost every single day to see if I can 'possibly' get my medications after waiting 25 plus minutes inside or out... want to contact me? Do it. mitomommy@gmail.com "
"I am now officially done with Best Buy.   I am sure this will get deleted.  I purchased over $7K with BB this season, and I would take it all back right now if I could.  I used the reward points from my $7K purchase to try to buy a product that was supposed to be available in store.  Well, their inventory was apparently off and canceled my order.  Worst of all, they are telling me it could take up to 15 days to get the points back in my account.  Best Buy = The Worst Customer Service.  If you dont change your ways, you will not be in business in 2013."
"sent this email to you via your website back in September and never got a response.  I just want to be sure SOMEONE sees this!  Thank you!   email 9-30-12 Please note that I love your stores & appreciate the freebies you give out.  I've shopped with you for years!  I've spent literally thousands of dollars in your stores.  That said, I need to complain about one of your cashiers who has twice now given me major attitude when I visit your store to redeem freebie coupons you have supplied me.  Each coupon states one per customer.  When my friend and I go together to both cash in our coupons, she has twice now tried to ring us up together and when we tell her we are going to use separate transactions, the attitude begins.  She won't look at us, scowls during the transaction, and last night she completely ignored me when I asked her a question about my petperks acct being used for my transaction.  She just didn't say a word.  She gave me my total, took my money, and just stood there looking at the floor.  Then my friend gave her their freebies and she said nothing at all.  NOTHING!  He didn't owe any money at the end of the transaction and she just shoved his purchase at him and said NOTHING.  Would not look either of us in the eye!  I felt like a criminal!  And we were doing NOTHING wrong!  My receipt has no name on it but this happened in the 1st register closest to the entrance doors, the cashier was a woman with light brown hair in a pony tail, and the receipt says ""community cashier - 470788.""  The sale number is T-1610 C-101101 1238/101.  I noticed too that it does not show that my petperks account was used and that is the question I asked her that she completely ignored.  I just felt you guys needed to know that you have a cashier that obviously has issue with coupon users working at this store.  I know that I will avoid her lane at all costs from now on, if I even bother to return.  Just don't like being treated like I am doing something wrong when I am not!  I would appreciate a response to my message.  Thank you!"
"Yes so tonight I get into DFW terminal c Laye from New York...flights late due to weather...no big deal it happens...I make it to my connecting gate c16, the plane is about to boarding and almost ready to pull out. The gate nazi says to me I will have to check my carry on...I explained I can't check it and he tells me I can't take the flight then...I say we'll book me on another one and he says sure and books me 3hrs later group 4...starts telling me its my choice if I miss the flight and doesn't offer any kind of voucher (keep in mind my bag fits under the seat) I ask for the supervisor and he says he is the supervisor...I ask for his boss (Michelle Prue) and he says she is in a meeting and he won't bother her for this. He sends me to another gate and then these two gate attendants at C4 give me the run around and start to tell me how it's all my fault...I join the admirals club one day pass for $50.00 and they actually help me...they tell me Michelle will be done at 6pm...so I wait a couple of hours and try to explain the situation and ask for some type of voucher and to be reimbursed for the club...she says sorry she can't help me. Now I've traveled with American for years and have over 500,000 miles with them (give or take) over the last ten years...I have never been treated so awful by any company at all levels... No wonder you are going under. I recommended any other airline but American... Your service is so poor it's really not believable. I WILL NEVER FLY WITH YOU AGAIN!!!!"
Thanks for nothing! Good to know warranty for my laptop that expires 6/1/12 actually expires at midnight on 5/31/12. Also thanks for selling me a TV that you knew had audio issues and leaving it to me to contact the manufacturer. You have inspired me to do my future electronics shopping online! :-)
"We refused to fly United. When we left Germany we flew Luftansa, they we SO good to our pugs. They let them fly together, they took very good care of them and as my mom's checked bag it was only 400 american. This is why (at least in Germany) service members are having to leave their petsd behind to be abandoned. Not cool. I will NEVER fly United. I would rather DRIVE to my next duty station. OR swim the ocean!"
I HATE DISCOVER CARD NOW...THEY DONT BACK U UP ON DISPUTES AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS ARE VERY RUDE...GLAD THAT I LEAVE DISCOVER CARD AT HOME SHREDDED UP....
"Do not buy a computer from this store! After 6 months our HP laptop stopped working. We paid for a HP laptop, the Geek Squad to set up new computer, Data transfer from old computer and extra 2 years of warranty.  Now Best Buy wants to charge us 160.00 to recover any data (they only charged 80.00 originally) and they said they have the right to keep the computer 30 days to fix it. This is not a warranty. this is a big fat rip off!!!!"
"risked my life on black Friday to shop at your store to get $20 off coupon.  Extremely long lines with 2 registers closed then, with 60 people in each line, YOU CLOSE A REGISTER!  Man in line goes ballistic, then I notice he has bullets in his hand.  Now I find out that this stupid $20 off doesn't work! Nike is excluded even though that is not mentioned.  Worst customer service award goes to Dicks...Congratulations"
"Seriously what is your problem today southwest. All the other times I have ever been delayed this much with you has been weather related which I get, but doing a plane swap, then sending that swap to mechanical? Delaying a already later evening flight 2 and 1/2 hrs. Get a better plan. You are better than this bs! I feel like I'm flying delta."
"Dear Dollar Tree,    I am writting you today yo advice you that your store located on 7400 Rivers Ave. N. Chas SC, absolutely has the most horrible customer service. I understand that you are only a discounted store but you can teach your employees to have some kind of perk in the customer service area. For i know if they dont want their job. Someone else will. When i am done checking out this morning. This will be my lasr time using your services. Have a good day."
I am getting very frusrated dealing with this company.I purchased a 500.00 item 2 weeks ago that i was told would be shipped in 5-7 days.I have called 2 times and keep getting told a different story for shipping.Also the same article i am waiting for is advertised if bought by dec19 you will get by dec25.I am very disappointed.
881 delayed YET AGAIN for servicing. Now 6 out of the last 7 flights to tokyo that's had issues. Glad to see all the efforts at improving your pax's experience $mi$ek.
Dear CVS: I just waited for 70 minutes to get my prescriptions filled only to find out that they couldn't process my insurance and couldn't figure out why.  I listened to pharmacists belittle customers asking for help.  I watched the store manager try to bang some 16 year old.  I listened to them explain to customers that they didn't have stock.  I'm used to crappy service.  Your pharmacy is by far the worst i've ever been to.  Rite Aid is better. Walgreens is better. Local grocery stores are better.  You are not better than any pharmacy that has or ever will exist.  Your systems are horrible. Your people are angry and bitter and full of self loathing.  I only go to your pharmacy because I have to.  I pray every day that your CEO gets found out to be embezzling money and you go out of business.  I beg my company to allow me to go somewhere else.
I really appreciate the fact that you have 15 teller windows and only 2 tellers working... I had nothing else to do today!
I hate you BOA for what you put us through trying to put my brothers business in order. Your policies SUCK!
Not sure how so many people aren't upset with your service.  I've had -so many- bad experiences with your customer service.
"AMERICAN....what in the heck are y'all doing in your customer service dept? I talked my daughter into buying miles, to use for her honeymoon in February, and y'all have totally dropped the ball!!!! Thanks for NOTHING and adding even MORE stress to planning a destination wedding!!! I forgot why I STOPPED flying with y'all years ago!! NO WONDER Y'ALL ARE GOING BANKRUPT....."
"Dear CVS, are you unaware that it is flu season?  Just tried to get my daughter's Rx for Tamaflu filled.  Not only did the CVS in Hickory Hills not have it, but also, none of the stores in the area had it either.  Then was told ""not optimistic about it being in the store tomorrow either.   So not liking you right now!    #Walgreenstotherescue!"
Sitting here on hold with the Walmart pharmacy in Poulsbo pharmacy going on 32 minutes now. Guess they don't answer simple questions. Now I have to take off and waste the gas and time to go all the way there to answer a simple question. it obviously doesn't cost them anything. Why shop elsewhere? Here is ANOTHER reason.
Your automated system sucks!  Had a fraudulent charge and took 20 min + to get the right person on the phone!
Do you train your employees not to hold utter contempt for your paying customers?  You might want to start.
DO NOT bank with US Bank.  They don't know what customer service is and do NOT value their customers.
"I bought the Iris Blooms yesterday at 4th and King, SF. There were suppose to be 9 and when I took them out, there were only 8. Now, I have 2nd guess if I buy flowers from Safeway. Quality control is critical!"
well let us see if the social media has any power at all. Dencia the closing manager at Target Clinton Keith store in Murrieta is rude. I work had for my money. I do not have to spend my money at Target. there are to many friendly stores to shop at in Murrieta & Temecula. Pass the word
"Although I have submitted an electronic claim for concern, just wanted to let you guys know to be careful when eating Milk Duds. As my husband and I were sharing a box I bit into a dud with a little something extra. It's a little white thing with a few dots and to me it looks like part of a tooth. I know what you all are thinking and the answer is no, it didn't come from my mouth. We checked and there are no missing bits from me!"
I am thoroughly disappointed with your photo service.  One of your stores ruined my negatives!  I should have known better than to trust a Rite-Aid photo lab tech!
"Your customer service is a bloody nightmare to deal with. I was a Wachovia customer for many years, and I'm just done with you. Thanks for the headache."
"Hey, I'm sitting here on hold to Dole cutomer ""service"".  Received a lovely slice of plastic in my bagged salad.  When I emailed to tell them, I got a phone number to call,  and now I sit on hold.  I have already told them the ISBN and product # and all other information but they have no respons by email.  I have to call THEM too.  In other words I have to jump through hoops because THEY made a dangerous and disgusting mistake with their product."
"You make someone check a bag in which they are flying overnight - but wait there's A TON of room in overhead. You LOSE the luggage and send to a city in which the person is NOT even traveling. But wait, your customer service certain can't even locate the bag now. $700 for this flight. UNACCEPTABLE."
still waiting on a reply about my iTouch issue from over a month ago...all I hear is : it's been sent to the appropiate team...I am NOT happy. I was told by YOUR salesperson the protection lan covered EVERYTHING...think it's team you have a team meeting and get me a replacment iTouch.
"Today is the day that you lost my business.  I am a Silver Medallion Member and previously loyal to your airline.  After today's customer service, I can honestly say I will never fly you ever again.  I say what I mean....just booked a $3000 worth of flights with a different airline.  Thought I should write to let you and the rest of your members know."
BOA is the WORST!! I have tolerated your poor customer service reps for years but I will not tolerate you trying to STEAL! How is an account that's NOT overdrawn being charged not one but TWO overdraft fees?! Who does that?! I will be changing banks.
Worst customer service I have ever experienced.  Charged me $200 extra to sit next to my wife on my honeymoon and when I inquired about it they simply stated that is just our policy.  Wow!  I can promise I will never use this airline again.
Very disappointed in the fact I bought 5 games and 3 don't work!
"Such poor, poor customer service on here!!!!  Look at all the complaints and not ONE GameStop person replies to any wall posts!"
I just love bein g put on hold for 10 minutes just to get hung up on. Thanks for the WONDERFUL customer service.
Last time I EVER use best buy. Worst experience and customer service I have ever dealt with AND they flat out lie!
"trying to call, and when I get transferred to an agent, it just hangs up on me.  get your act together united!"
"With UA taking away Elite benefits, I'm going out AA next flt. UAs bad behavior does not deserve a reward from pax"
Your customer service number is awful.  I had to type in my info 10 different times and then I get put on hold!
"The Kroger on W. Markam in Little Rock, AR needs to be inspected for quality control.  This is a photo I took yesterday of the jets that spray water on all the produce."
The manger at the White Cloud Michigan Family Dollar needs to be FRIED !!! she is mean and nasty.
"Wow Delta, Your Customer service rep was remakably rude and just hung up on me. Who does that??????"
"I think the customer service strategy is to put people on hold to a call center in the far east for almost an hour and then have the customer service rep repeat over and over again ""we are so sorry Mr. Dakin.. is there anything else we can help you with?""   over and over again.  The strategy is that we will give up... great strategy Delta !   Really good.   Really makes me happy."
Thank you Banquet dinners.  How did you know I like my chicken parmesan to be soggy and made with low quality dark meat?  You really nailed it.
Best buy is terrible at care and customer service.  The burlington ma store broke my third row seating. After putting in pillows that took weeks to order.
How can you place a customer on hold for 4hrs??????????????????????????????????????????
US Bank Internet banking is a waste of time.
@ Denver airport. Ran to catch the flight @ reached before the gates were closed but the agent still did not let me in. I told her this is ridiculous customer service & she did not care. Business travelers should just quit flying American. It is a mess !!
"I just purchased 3- bed-in a bags, totaling $175.00, that is including S&H.  So that clears my account.  I just received 1 bed-in the bag, and now you have deducted $50.00 for it.  Talking to customer service is like talking to someone in another country.  Why is this so difficult to understand.  I have already paid for all three, why do I need to ""repay""?  All three were ordered at the same time, why  aren't they coming in one shippment.  I think you all have thaken your little moniker ""Tarjay""aken to seriously."
"I had the worse experience with your airline on Feb 21 LHR-JFK flight 2. First, your Sky Lounge staff was rude, and refused us access to your Sky Lounge with our American Express card and refused to understand or verify the partnership your airline has with Amex Platinum. Your staff at the gate was also rude and acted like they couldn't be bothered with the passengers. And to make things worse, your KLM partner, with whom you booked my flight from Amsterdam to London damaged my $600 bag and refused to address the issue. I have silver status with you guys, and trust me, it's the last time I fly with you. I regret having my Amex points transferred to you, too. Worse. Airline. Ever."
"I picked up the laptop yesterday, Dec 11 that was due Dec 3.  The pickup too was a goat rope.  They had not sent me a notice, but I found out it was there by the tracking number.  This made it difficult since the proper release form had not yet been generated.  I am going back to my old way of doing business.  Is there a guaranteed delivery date?  What happens if the date is not met?  In writing?  No product -- no money.  No guarantee -- no money. One last thing for Best Buy; disregard for consumer rights = customers go elsewhere."
I purchased a can of cream of chicken soup yesterday at walmart. I open it today (expiration date Jan 2014) & it is COMPLETELY filled with mold. Contacted both campbells & walmart & neither thought it seemed to be a huge problem. Be careful which cans you are choosing!
"Making Technology work for you? When? I had great customer service tonight but....Warranty issue: and my complaint is that I paid for it and It still does not get the TV fixed and much to my dismay, they have to fix 3 things wrong with the TV in order to get a replacement. :-( very It still does not get the TV fixed and much to my dismay, they have to fix 3 things wrong with the TV in order to get a replacement. :-( very sad about that."
"wow, three comments removed today, love the customer support! Get rich, executives! If you paid as much attention to customers, as you do to your FB page, I would not have closed ALL my accounts, after 25 years of being a loyal customer!  Lets see how long this comment lasts. I think you put more people on this detail than you do on the entire credit card division!  DISLIKE."
"So I attempted to pay a BofA credit card via the internet.  Apparently the payment was being credited to ANOTHER card and I wasn't aware of it until it was too late.  BofA cancelled my credit card - no call, nothing.  Thanks BofA... for NOTHING"
"Used US Airway for a flight from Phoenix to Dallas Ft Worth Friday 4/20/12.  Flight attendants stated the overhead was full, so they wanted to check carry on bags.  I offered to gate check , but since I was not first class, or a platinum, or gold member they would not.  It's not that they were unable, they were unwilling.  I brought the bag on board, and there was plenty of room.   The flight was miserable, the attendants were indifferent and rude.  Also the flight was about 20 minutes late.  NEVER AGAIN  USELESS AIR!!!"
"Your customer service team is very rude, one hung up on me so I could not take the survey.  I plan on getting into the credit union in my new location and having the loan purchased.  I don't even care if it's going to cost me extra money."
"I shop at Target ALL the time and spend more money than I (or my husband) would like to think.  So, I'm really upset that I've been having such bad experiences with your site lately.  Today, I shopped online and when I went to checkout, every time I hit the checkout button, it would simply refresh the page and would not take me to the log in page.  So, I called to place the order over the phone.  She took my info, I gave her all the item numbers and she started processing my order.  I was surprised when she stated there was a $13.99 shipping charge on the order, because when I searched for the products, I specifically filtered by items that were free ship eligible.  She looked into it & 2 items were free ship eligible, but she said the other one was not.  She stated that item 11872934 was not eligible.  When I go to your kids' bedding tab and filter by ""free ship eligible"" this set comes up.  After I pointed it out to her and she confirmed that it was indeed wrong, she said I would still have to pay shipping and she couldn't take it off.  Really?  If your site shows something as free ship eligible in error, you should honor it.  So, I spent 15 minutes on the phone and got nowhere.  This is very upsetting.  Especially on the heels of Target losing one of my 14 item orders and simply returning all the items back to my credit card.  You can do better than this!"
WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE PURCHASING WALGREENS PRESCRIPTION CARD ! I PURCHASED ONE IN MAY WHEN MY HUSBAND LOST HIS JOB AND WE LOST OUR INSURANCE $ 35.00 TO COVER US BOTH FOR 1 YEAR. THEY GAVE US A PRINT OUT OF WHAT OUR PRESCRIPTIONS WOULD COST AND WHEN WE WENT BACK FOR REFILLS PRICES HAD WENT UP ANYWHERE BETWEEN 7 TO $ 10.00 . ALSO THE QUALITY OF THE MEDICATION IS NOT GOOD. I COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS CARD ON HERE ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD CONTACT ME BY E-MAIL WITHIN 2 TO 3 DAYS. HAVEN'T RECEIVED AN E-MAIL YET !!!!!
"YOUR WALMART IN MIDDLETOWN, OHIO HAS THE MOST RUDEST EMPLOYEES I HAVE EVER MET. WENT IN TO BUY A TV. AND THEY WERE VERY, VERY RUDE."
American Airlines stranded my 3 year old son and wife stranded in Dallas. They still won't help. I hope corporate is listening before this video hits CNN
VERY UNHAPPY  WITH YOUR SHEETS I SPENT A FORTUNE ON A KING SIZE SHEET SET AND THEY DON'T FIT ARGHH! I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!! VERY UNHAPPY!!!!!!
"I stopped at Target of Toms River today, April 10, to get a new Wii game for my daughter.  While there I picked up a quart of buttermilk.  When I got home, I was surprised to see the expiration / sell by date was April 2.  It was not worth my while to make the 20 minute round trip to exchange it.  Besides, 8 days expired is beyond the accepltable limit.  I will probably choose another retailer next time I need to purchase something.  David Bohola."
"We had an unbelievably bad experience on UNITED AIRLINES last weekend. My daughter, her husband and three children under 7 were separated. Husband and 16 month old were put on a flight they all had reservations for. Young mother and two kids under 8 were denied passage because they didn't reach the gate on time having been held up boarding their dog. Okay...that's bad, BUT they were booked on the following day (ugh) and arrived again at FIVE A.M and denied seats.No record of their reservations. Tears, heartache and much inefficiency placed them on the flight in separate seats. Due to passengers working together the five year old was placed with his mother. The seven year old sat alone. I am a media rep and I am going to repeat this story to anyone who wants to travel as a family.   Press release for TRAVEL SECTIONS being prepared ASAP  By the"
who do I need to talk to about this ????? about 2 weeks ago I when to the WALGREEN in MONROE NC about starting getting my DIABETES supple from ya ... the girl in the PHARMACY got all my info to contact my DOCTOR to get a new prescription for me .... she told me when I had a few days left of my TEST STRIPS come back in and it would be ready to refill ... when I had 2 days left I called in to re order ... no one contacted my DOCTOR ...

This is getting ridiculous....been 3 weeks since I started trying to get this title issue resolved...been waiting get my car registered and can't do it because I can't get any cooperation from Ally Bank
When are you guys are going to fix the yours ATM machine at the conroy with kirkman rd branch Orlando Florida . Every Friday that machine is broken . The line is worst then social security office .
Four attempts to call United in the last four days.  On hold for each call at least 90-120 minutes before being cut-off.  Glad to see that United ended up using Continental's phone system after the merger.
Too bad you don't put customers first...nothing worse than long lines with only two registers open
"Tthe most screwed up operation I have ever seen !! 2-3 hour delay with endless excusses that were point blank lies. When confronted about the lies response was ""we can't answer that at this time"" over and over again! was offered taxi fair at my final destination... BIG Problem... there were NO Delta representatives at final destination!  BIG Help!!! also 50 minute to get luggage for approximate 30 passengers!!!  NEVER AGAIN  and will forward to everyone of my business partners."
"US 708 PHL - MUC. Departure 6:30pm, Time now 3:30am still waiting for the Second maintenance on the aircraft. No willing for compensation nor a Hotel room for the night. Crew members confessing that the coordination is out of control.  Thank you for choosing US Airways?!?"
"Your pharmacy in Ft. Worth, Texas off Berry St. by TCU is absolutely the worst pharmacy ever. I have continuously had issues with them and they really take on more than they can handle. I HATE when I have to fill here..."
"Submitted a prescription to cvs on benton rd. Temecula. Chandra the pharmacist refused to fill it. Said it was not written properly.It came from Loma Linda hospital. After I called the emergency dr. at the hospital and he called Chandra she still refused to fill the prescription. I had to take it to Walgreens where it was filled immediately without question. I was with cvs over 7 years. The demeaning attitude and the bums rush from cvs.. Pharmacist Chandra, will cost them dearly. I also put in a call to"" Princess"" who handles problems for cvs. She did not have the time or desire to return my call. The problem i had with her, lack of professionalism. It appears the cvs chain has customers to spare."
"CVS, back in November I picked up a few bottles of Excedrin. The bottles that I have, have been recalled. I called my local CVS and the cashier knew nothing of the recall. I told her that I don't have my receipt and that I would have to contact the company. She told me that with no receipt I could not return the items, and since she knew nothing of the recall their was nothing she could do. So I now have to pay to send the bottles back to the company? I think I will probably just throw them out. I'm really disappointed in how CVS handles products that have been recalled.."
Still don't have our luggage! Actually just tracked one that successfully made it to O'Hare airport and it looks like you sent it to Detroit. I never knew so many idiots could work in one place.
Just bought a $399 rebuilt computer for my family for Christmas and when it arrived it didn't work.  Hmmm.  Nothing like opening a broken Christmas present.
Worst shopping experience ever i will go to target from now on ...
Best buy on Rockville Pike in MD has some of the worst customer service I have experienced in a while. EPIC FAIL BEST BUY!!
your customer service  is only a run around no help at all
Thanks for canceling our flights home form Las Vegas and only offering return flights that have lay overs. Your the best American Airlines. Y'all suck.
"I am over your store in Park Forest, Il!  Poor customer service, horribly long lines anytime of the day and the store and parking lot are always filthy.  We'll be going to Walgreen from now on."
What is the point of asking what time  I would like to pick up my medicine when it's NEVER Ready to be picked up at the time indicated!!! Always an hour and a half later!! *Frustrating*
"SUNTRUST: HORRIBLE ONLINE BANKING!!!   We just spent 2.5 hours bouncing around various escalations in the online banking department (877 884 4480 ext. 61054 and 61096) to get a simple electronic (CSV) export of business account over the last 3 years. This by the way has been something I have been able to do in under a minute with pretty much everyone else I bank with. For many years now.  Do you know that the Suntrust branches actually told me they still store their documents on Microfiche! It would cost $300 to pull it off and hand print 3 years of statements. Just wow. Welcome to the year 1941.   I have a background in the electronic banking industry, and this is a VERY SIMPLE request if they just would put me through to a database admin. They literally said they would not because they can't do it for everyone.   Just the most pathetic thing I have ever heard. The fact that you can export only 60 days of data via the website is also pathetic. The Suntrust online bank website is by far the worst of any of the banks I use. Inflexible, terrible usability, slow, and broken a good amount of the time. I can't access bill pay at this very moment! I really only keep them because they have a branch close to me.  I think this is the last straw tho.. I am taking my business elsewhere. Suntrust should be ashamed of themselves. Truly worthless.  PS: SunTrust if you actually care about my business and *YOUR* business for that matter, you are welcome to contact me via FB. But I want someone executive level. Probably either the office of CMO Rilla Delonier (the Live Solid, Bank Solid lady (how ironic is that?) or CIO Anil Chriyan.. I am tired of talking to your useless customer ""service"".  I will be glad to give you a log on to a small credit union I use whose website literally blows yours away. Perhaps you can buy them and use their technology.   PPS: This is what exasperated customers are reduced to. Sorry for the rant. "

I called the 800 number on your website today to cancel an item.  The item is Ben 10 Omniverse 3DS game.  I want to cancel the item because the shipment has been delayed three times since I placed the order.  I spoke with a representative named Mary on 11/28/12 at 9:06 am.  She stated that the item was ready to ship and that she couldn't cancel it.  I asked to speak with a supervisor since my account hasn't been charged and usually is when an order is ready to ship.  At 9:22am a supervisor named Ashley (she said her id # is .851141118) got on the phone.  I started to tell her the situation she kept trying to speak over me so I asked her to be please let me speak.  She did then proceeded to tell me that the item wasn't in stock and she couldn't cancel it.  I asked why it couldn't be cancelled since it was not ready to be shipped and I haven't been charged for it yet.  She told me that I only had thirty minutes after I placing an order to cancel so the item couldn't be cancelled.  I did start to interrupt to say that I was not informed when I placed the order that the item was not in stock at which time she told me to be quiet and let her finish.  She then proceeded to tell me that I need to read my emails better.  I asked to speak with her supervisor.  She told me that if I wanted to go over her head I needed to send an email.  This person was extremely rude and needs some serious customer service training.  In addition the issue I called about it still unresolved.  I have since gone back and reviewed me email.  It does not state that this game was not in stock or that this was a pre order.
"Bank of America's website and customer service is crap!  I went online to pay a credit card and the numbers on the bill pay page did not match the numbers on the accounts page.  Old numbers were on the bill pay page and I did not know which one was for the card I wanted to pay.  I called to have this corrected and was told that since I was not the primary holder, they needed to talk to my husband.  I had to drag him off the lawnmower to give the person permission to talk to me to get this fixed.  I was told it would be fixed within 72 hours.  I just checked and now only 1 account is on the bill pay page.  I called again to have this fixed and again was told that they needed to speak to my husband.  He isn't here, I told them that I just wanted the page fixed like I was told that it would be last Friday, isn't there any notes from Friday on file giving me permission to HAVE YOU FIX YOUR SITE?  No, they had to talk to my husband TO GET PERMISSION TO FIX THEIR OWN SITE!!!  What a pain in the butt!  Good God, just look it up and FIX IT...why in the world do you need to talk to any of your customers??!!??  JUST FIX IT!!!"

"Went to Dicks Sporting Goods in Peoria today, and lets just say the manager represented the name very well. My husband was trying out a weight station and the manager comes over and says can I help you sir? Then continues to ramble on about how they can't do that with the equipment as they are displays, all  while talking as if my husband was a child. my husband said...ok and he continues to go on. Little did he know that we were serious about purchasing this equipment. So the other item we were going to purchase was left behind, and you lost about a 500.00 sale. He was rude and talking to us in the manner he did was terrible. I will give my business to Duhnams. We had shopped at Dick's for years. We will not be shopping any of your stores in the future."
"BOA has to implement a better phone system.  I've been trying to reach the local branch for almost an hour to no avail and if I chose any other option, I cannot get a REAL HUMAN BEING!!   Please, I've complained about this at my local branch in CT and it's not only not better, it's worse."
