**The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) is the largest auto racing sanctioning body in the United States. Each year, NASCAR organizes hundreds of races across 48 states, as well as in Canada, Mexico, and Europe. Known worldwide for its colorful paint schemes, banked turns, high speeds, and aggressive racing style, the sport has evolved greatly throughout its 74-year history.**

**In recent years, NASCAR has imposed new rules and regulations regarding how teams may build and operate their cars, so much so that many critics of the sport have argued that itâ€™s now easier than ever to be successful. Can driver success be defined by more than merely going fast and turning left?**

**The following analysis examines data collected from the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series race at the Watkins Glen International road course. The goal of this analysis is to determine which factors go about best explaining success on the race track. For the context of this analysis, success will be evaluated by finishing position and points earned. The lower the finishing position, the better the driver performed. The more points earned, the better the driver performed.**

### **Average Running Position vs. Points**

**Regression Equation: ** `Points` = 51.498 - 1.612 x `Average_Running_Position` 

**Hypothesis Test:**

**$H_0$: ** $\beta$~Average_Running_Position~ = 0    
**$H_A$: ** $\beta$~Average_Running_Position~ $\ne$ 0      
**Confidence Level: ** $\alpha$ = 0.05    
**F-statistic : ** 288   
**p-value: ** 2.2 Ã— 10^-16^      
**Conclusion: ** Reject $H_0$
